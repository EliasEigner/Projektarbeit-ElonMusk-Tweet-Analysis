@tylerthecreator thanks for ordering a car!
@thefrownyface @massossltd I read a story about a father whose son died incredibly quickly. Can be as little as half an hour in hot sun.
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.

@SpaceX There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.

Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles, 4X further than moon.
If you are curious about the P85D, you can schedule a test drive here: http://t.co/Eu19pBUpNO
P85 acceleration will also improve, but not quite as much
Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.
Reason is Newton's Third Law. In vacuum, there is nothing to "push" against. You must react against ejected mass.
If u saw @TheSimpsons and wonder why @SpaceX doesn't use an electric rocket to reach orbit, it is cuz that is impossible
West Coast droneship under construction will be named "Of Course I Still Love You"
Good primer on the exponential advancement of technology, particularly AI http://t.co/1c30ZwJ8Y5
@thomasmuirhead Good piece
Next rocket landing on drone ship in 2 to 3 weeks w way more hydraulic fluid. At least it shd explode for a diff reason.
@ID_AA_Carmack Rocket hits hard at ~45 deg angle, smashing legs and engine section http://t.co/PnzHHluJfG
Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
Launching in one minute
Btw, we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall &amp; connects like a solid metal snake. For realz.

@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.

Launch in ~1.5 hours if weather clears. Lightning tower struck earlier, but no effect on rocket or satellite http://t.co/AWdx9LsFZt
Model S limits torque if brake &amp; accel simul pressed. Going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety hazard.
@WillOremus That has been my goal from the beginning. Need the Gigafactory for Model 3.
Three engine F9R Dev1 vehicle auto-terminated during test flight. No injuries or near injuries. Rockets are tricky …
@awadsayeed Yes. Technically Model 3 or maybe three horizontal bars. Won't be three vertical bars.
@BillGates @RyanSeacrest @TEDchris Am a bit under the weather, but will do it!
Looks like body slam, maybe from a self-generated wave

@QuantumG When we launch I want to know that SpaceX has done everything possible to keep the astronauts safe. Only a few more years to go.
Either way, this case certainly deserves close examination by the DoD Inspector General per @SenJohnMcCain's request http://t.co/IZ4JO2y3JO
@Oatmeal may all technology in the future follow the zeroth law...
@Oatmeal I would be happy to help
Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed
@MarinaSBlinova Rocket boost stage reaching 0 m/s in one piece :) Will know soon. Odds not high.

Tesla US business leasing program went live today http://t.co/wCH0GLAEAJ
@AKAbrahamson @itsDanielSuarez Yeah, that's worth a read
Bloomberg article today also has oddly false details. I don't eat breakfast at Tesla and drink coffee, not juice.
@cairnz 80% to 30%
@FlateFred agreed
@jnags92 Yes, I'm confident that Tesla will do something with them.
@TeslaRoadTrip Thanks, I really appreciate your support!
Tesla policy is to charge the same price (+ taxes &amp; shipping) everywhere in the world http://t.co/cXOtokcBeG
@bonnienorman @TeslaMotors @TeslaMotorsClub Merry Christmas!
@TierraUniversu Doesn't sound right. If it is, we certainly need to fix it. Investigating...
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
Will do another static fire of rocket to make sure all is good &amp; AF needs to test ICBMs, so probable launch Sept 29/30.
It is crazy that the proposed California high speed rail only goes 200 mph w avg speed of 130 mph when Japan is 300 mph+
Was at Vandenberg today going over the upcoming next gen F9 rocket launch. Some tense days ahead http://t.co/bfXnFt7alm
@brynmooser Reality is the best illusion
Pulled all nighter working on Hyperloop (as did others). Hopefully not too many mistakes. Will publish link at 1:30 PDT.
Best saying ever “@temochdez: there is a saying in Mexico: "El miedo no anda en burro" meaning "Fear doesn't ride on a donkey"”
Will publish Hyperloop alpha design by Aug 12. Critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated.
Just completed full mission duration firing of next gen Falcon 9 booster. V proud of the boost stage team for overcoming many tough issues.
UDP (yeah you know me) 3X
Woohoo, Tesla direct sales petition passed the 100k threshold! Thanks a lot to everyone that helped!!
@lougil_ace Taking action. Will be a 7 day grace period for $2500 ext warranty. Neg margin at that price, so must unfortunately raise.
@arthurblake Turning recirc off, windows closed and the right film on rear glass usually works. Am asking HVAC engineering to investigate.
Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars, past and present. It was always there.
@zatulsky Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap), but the technology is not.
1st long duration firing of the new generation Falcon 9 rocket ~1.5 million pounds of vac thrust http://t.co/iGZadNVF7w
@SQMInc I don't have a publicist

Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix.
@VarunG_ Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
@karlbrauer Making rockets
@McBartVolgers @SpaceX High pressure helium pneumatic bolts and pistons. No explosives.
@xyrth Cool, will get one plus another chicken
@TalulahRiley You're welcome. It did seem like the chicken of destiny xx
@SeanChin @RaimisJ Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
@danielmarshal15 It can dig up almost anything.
@grimmerkimmer @dpinsen Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story http://t.co/LWr3GODxBG
There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
@mjasandoval Stay tuned
Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck
Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!
Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla http://t.co/MNUIWDxoXt
@fink_justin It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother
@Vangsgutane Norway rocks!
@thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry http://t.co/l5LOXtyP33
@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
@realbhuwan @teslamotors Cool :)

Grasshopper rocket flies up 250m, holds against wind and lands. Vid taken from our hexacopter http://t.co/LXmMCYDD0e

Cool picture of Io crossing Jupiter sent to me by @shervin. Would be amazing to visit in person one day.
New York judge states: "... dealers cannot utilize the Franchised Dealer Act as a means to sue their competitors". Exactly!
Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in Austin. Will hang around after press conf to thank people in person.
@derrickgott007 already partly here with rocket development, but will make it a lot bigger with the launch site
At the risk of losing more "cool points", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton &amp; JFK. Good people on both sides...
@quietlybear Do all the intro courses for mech, EE, aero and physics, then specialize in the one you like most.
@fleijerstam @gronnbilnorge We are working hard to make that happen!

Slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions -- will be Tues next week.
But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride
.@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner.

@DrKnowItAll16 The Starlink V3 WiFi router is *much* better. Please lmk if you notice the difference.

We are also super focused on getting latency below 20ms if the user terminal and ground gateway can both be seen by a single satellite.

P50 ping&lt;30ms is definitely achievable.
@MiddleearthMixr I heartily agree! Seeing all those ugly QR codes makes my eyes bleed.
@pmarca @CJHandmer It is rather tragic to see an otherwise capable comedian like @iamjohnoliver become weak sauce.

The reason he is not very funny these days is because he is too keen to pander to wokeness, which is fundamentally a lie, whereas great humor requires revealed truth.
@shaunmmaguire @sequoia The X investment will turn out well

@WallStreetSilv People often incorrectly think health care is a matter of money, but it is actually a matter of doctors per capita.

@SenSchumer Definitely
@Jason This is not to say that reporters in most western countries are simply coin-operated – they will defend their “independence” to the death, as acknowledging it at all would diminish their credibility.

But it is also false/foolish to suggest that there is no influence.
@Jason They claim to have a “wall” between news &amp; advertising, but reporters know full well who butters their bread.

@WhatsupFranks @chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan That would be interesting indeed
@chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan But it was a mistake to push for so many Covid-19 booster shots (even the initial vaccine shot was overkill on quantity).

There‘s obviously risk of the immune system going out of control when it sees what what you’ve trained it to believe is a serious disease over &amp; over again.
@chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan Accurate summary. Look, I’m prepared to argue in favor of vaccines if you’d like.

Do I think vaccines should be examined closely &amp; mortality risk isn’t substantially reduced in America? Yes. 

However, you should definitely take vaccines if traveling to places where that disease
@mcjamez I bought it anyway. Didn’t actually expect it to work like the video.

@farzyness Any scientist who refuses to be questioned is anything but
@farzyness To be frank, we’re lucky to have modern medicine. I’d be dead from malaria if not for chloroquine &amp; doxycycline.

But, we should still question medicine, rather than considering it sacred. The entire foundation of science is to question it, thereby coming closer to the truth.
@growing_daniel Still the most effective breath mint afaik
@TheRabbitHole84 @joerogan There is an argument that the negatives of SSRIs outweigh the positives
@GilliRoth @PeterHotez Exactly. Two of my kids are on the spectrum and they got it from me, not vaccines. It was obvious from when they were babies, but thankfully improved to some degree over time.
@PeterHotez First of all, I am generally pro vaccine. I have been vaccinated against pretty much everything, as have my kids.

But destroying public safety by electing DAs who won’t prosecute violent criminals needs to stop.
@WallStreetSilv Good point
@alx Just a formality. Alex has been de facto in charge for several years.
@StephenKing There is also equal treatment before the law. Differential prosecution undermines public faith in the justice system.
@RichardHanania But if you discriminate against everyone, then, tautologically, you’re not discriminating against anyone!
@andrewdoyle_com UK now understands. America will too.
@teslaownersSV @WR4NYGov Yeah
@LibertyCappy It is insane
@westcoastbill Soon
@MuskUniversity Almost always
@dvorahfr Very true
@shojopicture Amazing movie
@ggreenwald Interesting
@EvaFoxU I do use that word sometimes 😂
@fasc1nate The start of writing could be considered the beginning of civilization, in which case we are ~5500 years old. 

That is only a millionth of Earth’s existence! So far, we’re just a ⚡️in the 🍳.
@stclairashley He might not be wrong
@terronk A friend of mine experienced a shooting last night outside his apartment in SF and a bullet went through his wall. Second time it’s happened.
@Robber_Baron_ Yeah
@BasedTorba Amazing 🤣🤣
@Teslaconomics Thanks!
@jordanbpeterson @Mike_Pence @YouTube @helenjoyce Upload the video here on your X/Twitter account!
@RampCapitalLLC I don’t personally use decaf, but the placebo effect in general is remarkably powerful

@DavidSacks Whoa
@TeslaSynopsis With caffeine during the day, without caffeine late at night
@WallStreetSilv Madness
@stats_feed High time we went back and had a permanently occupied lunar base

@stillgray @jordanbpeterson @YouTube Yeah
@TheBabylonBee Indeed … sigh
@PeterDiamandis Optimism ftw

Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the Doges of war
@Austen The problem is that the passive/index funds outsource voting to shareholder services companies, which are controlled by activists who act in a manner contrary to the interests of shareholders. 

This is probably the biggest class-action opportunity in history.
@WallStreetSilv Where are they not?
@stillgray @AK4WA Any moral shield that cannot be questioned will be used by those who do evil
@stillgray @AK4WA Exactly
@zerohedge They’ve gone too far
@cb_doge It is
In a few weeks, X/Twitter will start paying creators for ads served in their replies. First block payment totals $5M.

Note, the creator must be verified and only ads served to verified users count.
@zerohedge Late stage civilization vibes
@DrKnowItAll16 Indeed
@Timcast @TheBabylonBee Seriously
@DC_Draino Good question
It is worth noting that kids who are same-sex attracted and/or autistic are the most vulnerable
Big difference
@teslaownersSV Yeah
Archived version https://t.co/IFstdkxq8o
@StephenKing Almost everyone would agree that no one is above the law, but it must be applied equally. 

Differential pursuit of justice undermines public faith in the system.
@MuskUniversity Yeah
@shadygrooove Kids who are so young they think Santa is literally true obviously cannot understand the concept of “gender”
Powerful article https://t.co/i9phxDRNqm
@EndWokeness The UK has centralized data, due to their national health service, so they know what a catastrophe this is

@ray4tesla We tried very hard to get EU to consider the Tesla (now NACS) design, as it is fundamentally better in every way for consumers, but the transport minister said “a committee decided the standard years ago” (sigh).

@shellenberger Haven’t seen anything &amp; I think I’d know
@alx There does seem to be far higher interest in pursuing Trump compared to other people in politics. 

Very important that the justice system rebut what appears to be differential enforcement or they will lose public trust.
@INTERIORPORN1 Beautiful
@SmokeAwayyy Yeah
It’d be great to have @maddow, @donlemon &amp; others on the left put their shows on this platform. No exclusivity or legal docs required!

@OyunerdeneMN @Tesla It was an honor to speak
@growing_daniel That’s a real number?
@Diablo It’s good
@stevenmarkryan @farzyness Ok fine we’ll do it
@dogeofficialceo Computers are definitely binary
@JacobMyth @MattWalshBlog Maybe total user-seconds of screen time
@MattWalshBlog That said, it simply counts if you saw the post on the X/Twitter app or via web browser, not how long you watched
@MattWalshBlog Correct
@MattWalshBlog View count is actually understated, as it does not include anything from our API, for example tweets you see in Google search results or on Bloomberg terminals
@stclairashley I will follow them if they post their shows on this platform
@krassenstein Community Notes plus user comments will be great for correcting or adding context

@jhall Tesla aspires to be as helpful as possible to other car companies.

We made all our patents freely available several years ago.

Now, we are enabling other companies to use our Supercharger network.

Also happy to license Autopilot/FSD or other Tesla technology.

@EndWokeness Not complicated at all
Consenting adults should do whatever makes them happy, provided it does not harm others, but a child is not capable of consent, which is why we have laws protecting minors.
@MattWalshBlog Works now. Only limit is that it will not be placed next to advertising.

@SmokeAwayyy A lot 😑
@stevenmarkryan The Streisand Effect on this will set an all-time record!
@cb_doge Yeah, it’s great
@TheRabbitHole84 @jimjimmiejames This is a major problem. I will be actively lobbying to criminalize making severe, irreversible changes to children below the age of consent. 

Shame on those who advocate this! It is utterly contemptible.
@stillgray @robbystarbuck @realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog @Twitter @JeremyDBoreing Commenting &amp; deliberate sharing will be allowed. Sensitive content just won’t be pushed to people unless they ask for it or a friend sends it to them.
@robbystarbuck @realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog @Twitter @JeremyDBoreing We’re updating the system tomorrow so that those who follow @realDailyWire will see this in their feed, but it won’t be recommended to non-followers (nor will any advertising be associated with it)

Worth considering for announcements in general.

If someone wants to change something about themselves as an adult, we should respect that decision. 

However, making an irreversible decision for a child is not the child’s decision, it is the adult’s decision, therefore lacking consent.

@imjdsharp @krassenstein Exactly
@WholeMarsBlog There are some jobs that can be done effectively at home, but it is super out of touch to suggest that most people should do so, given that it is impossible.

That’s why I likened it to “Let them eat cake”.
@krassenstein @SquawkCNBC @JGreenblattADL I mostly agree with that statement, but talk is cheap – results are what matter. 

Downtown SF &amp; LA, for example, are *not* how we want civilization to end up. They are like a low energy version of Mad Max / Last of Us.

@WholeMarsBlog There’s probably some really embarrassing stuff in the book 🤣

@SquawkCNBC @JGreenblattADL In fairness, I must concede that Joel has a good point and I will endeavor to be more thoughtful in the future.

Comic book analogies are obviously imperfect, to say the least. Just because George Soros can bend metal using his mind doesn’t mean he’s Magneto!!

They’re most effective against high profile publications &amp; people, where reply debates are less effective.

That is seriously messed up. The board of trustees should hang their heads in shame and apologize!
The more screentime users spend looking at a post, whether text, pic or video, the more it is boosted. 

Video posted natively to this platform will be boosted more than an external link, because way more time is spent watching a video than clicking on a link.

@EdKrassen @jacobincambodia I met with many other senior Democratic Party leaders too, many of whom, including Chuck Schumer, I have known for well over a decade.

The Schumer meeting was over an hour. He was kind, thoughtful and asked insightful questions about AI. This man cares about the American people.
@EdKrassen Thanks Ed, I appreciate the kind words. 

I almost never encounter negativity in gatherings where I can engage in dialogue with people. 

When I do encounter some negativity, it’s rare that they can point to anything specific, apart from “bad press”. 

Perhaps this comment thread

@krassenstein @ZubyMusic The Swedish study says “sex-reassigned transsexual persons of both genders had approximately a three times higher risk of all-cause mortality than controls”. 

If we take as given that the other study 2-3X suicide rate is correct, then doing surgery or chemical sterilization on

@krassenstein @ZubyMusic Please correct if wrong @CommunityNotes
@krassenstein @ZubyMusic Comprehensive study in Sweden shows *increased* suicide!

Death for sex-reassigned persons was higher than for controls of same birth sex, particularly death from suicide. They also had increased risk for suicide attempts and psychiatric inpatient care. 

https://t.co/hIakkEJvJb
@zerohedge Age limit for sterilization by the state or parents too? Or is that too much to hope for.
@krassenstein @ZubyMusic What research?

Every child goes through an identity crisis, but leaping to a permanent solution that sterilizes them for life before they could possibly consent for themselves is wrong. Plain and simple.
@TheRabbitHole84 We will do our best to support candidates from all parties, so that the public may make the most informed choice. 

Far too much back room dealing seems to be happening.
@RobertKennedyJr You and other candidates deserve that opportunity!
@tegmark Exactly
@ZubyMusic I agree. This is super messed up.

Mature, consenting adults should do as they wish, so long as they do not harm anyone else, but this child was too young for any kind of consent.

@teslaownersSV This will be great. Coming soon. Maximum protection for users.
@Anc_Aesthetics Sorry about this. Yes, subscribe now via web or wait a few days for Apple to approve. 

Note: creator gets ~92% of subscription for web subscribers (Stripe &amp; CC fees are ~8%), but only 70% on iOS/Android. 

Twitter keeps nothing. All funds we receive go to the content creator.
@stevenmarkryan Takes a few days for Apple to approve subscriptions, iOS lags web subscriptions by a few days
@TheRabbitHole84 Population collapse is a massive threat to civilization
Canadian Broadcasting Corp said they’re “less than 70% government-funded”, so we corrected the label https://t.co/lU1EWf76Zu

Learned a lot today, now offloading propellant, retrying in a few days …
A pressurant valve appears to be frozen, so unless it starts operating soon, no launch today

@ID_AA_Carmack I still have launch PTSD from early Falcon days. My limbic system twists my guts into a knot as we get closer to launch.

@SmokeAwayyy With booster ultimately flying up to ~20 times per day &amp; ship flying up to ~5 times per day. 

Useful load to Mars is ~150 metric tons, but requires ~5 orbital refilling tanker flights.

Target: &gt;1 megaton of cargo &amp; people delivered to Mars, so that it becomes self-sustaining.
@dvorahfr You should sign up for subscriptions, then, for example, post low res images free and high res for subscribers or whatever you want
@teslaownersSV There is massive uncertainty with a new launch. We don’t know exactly when it will fly.

For the next 12 months, Twitter will keep none of the money. 

You will receive whatever money we receive, so that’s 70% for subscriptions on iOS &amp; Android (they charge 30%) and ~92% on web (could be better, depending on payment processor).

@TimSweeneyEpic @ITIFdc This is why paid verification is essential. Won’t stop people using AI for impersonation &amp; scams, but it increases cost &amp; difficulty of doing so by several orders of magnitude.

@BBCWorld I do say in the interview that I have a lot of respect for the @BBC. No organization is perfect, or course, but the BBC overall quite good.

Just as with alcohol prohibition, people didn’t actually

@pri13420 @investmattallen @ShellenbergerMD @robbysoave Yes, but, more importantly, doing so by massive theft of Twitter data
@investmattallen @ShellenbergerMD @robbysoave We’re enabling users to post long articles &amp; earn income from subscribers, but we’re not excluding other media. 

Substack was temporarily categorized as “unsafe” when we discovered that they were illegally downloading vast amounts of data to pre-populate their Twitter clone.
@KanekoaTheGreat 2003 is an old survey, so Russian doesn’t dominate as much then as in 2012, but the point remains valid
@KanekoaTheGreat Almost no one among the cognoscenti even knows this. 

Why does our western press insist on pushing such a lopsided view of the conflict? 

They must either think that the public is too dumb to understand nuance or the press themselves lack a deep understanding.
@WallStreetSilv Their technology is so ancient. World of Warcraft economy is lightyears better (actually).
@LordTJCrypto Nice
An advantage of having organizational affiliation on this platform is that you can change your name without losing verification.

More importantly, it helps greatly with reducing impersonation fraud.
@micsolana I think we should legalize it. The probability of overdose or a bad batch is greatly reduced if there is actual QA &amp; regulation.

Also, crime flourishes when substances are made illegal. Alcohol is very much a “drug” – it’s just a legacy drug from olden times when we had no

@waitbutwhy The precision of our biological clock across trillions of cells is incredible. One never sees someone with an old left arm, but a young right arm.

Aging can obviously be fixed. The real question is whether it should be.
@davidmweissman @TitterDaily Too much corruption with how legacy checks were handed out in the past. 

As @TimSweeneyEpic said, accounts should grow or shrink their influence based on the quality of their posts, not because they were anointed by someone years ago at Twitter.
@stevenmarkryan Long-term thinking will be rewarded
@EndWokeness We need to add more granularity to editorial influence, as it varies greatly. I don’t actually think the BBC is as biased as some other government-funded media, but it is silly of the BBC to claim zero influence.

Minor government influence in their case would be accurate.
@WallStreetSilv I do actually follow the BBC – they have some great material

@ZubyMusic True
@EvaFoxU fazedarrayftw
@MiamiHerald Very misleading headline
@ZubyMusic @stillgray But awesome for trolling
@terrybythebay @TitterDaily Who … me? ☺️ 🧌
@wongmjane Not a bad suggestion. Will consider.
@TitterDaily Yeah, you can totally delete things from the Internet – that works perfectly and doesn’t draw attention to whatever you were trying to hide at all
@StephenKing Oh stop with the compliments! 😊
Starship is stacked &amp; ready to launch next week, pending regulatory approval
@DirtyTesLa We are gradually reducing it, proportionate to improved safety
@GRDecter Any highly successful investor with a long track record would do a good job – the job is essentially fund management at scale
@GRDecter Probably Buffett. He could do it using less than an hour’s time per week.
@cb_doge Actually, will add this app to my name in the meantime
@KanekoaTheGreat Is this real?
@MuskUniversity 2008 was hell
@cb_doge As soon as we finish functionality for multi-org affiliation
@RubinReport @ChristinaPushaw @MiamiHerald If they’re misleading the public, @CommunityNotes will correct them
@TitterDaily Almost all major organizations are in process of rolling out affiliate badges. 

This is very important for protecting users against sophisticated impersonation scams.
@NASAWebb Best pic of Uranus ever
@cb_doge Fact check: correct
@NASA @NASAWebb Good one 🤣🤣
@SciGuySpace They need to make reusable rockets
@cb_doge Cool
@BillyM2k Exactly
@paulg I love fashion tbh
@kaschuta What is surprising is that so few people realize this.

Individuals should always wonder who wrote the software running in their head. 

Don’t be an NPC.
Starship preparing for launch  🚀 https://t.co/M1pR8rsmYt
@BoredElonMusk Wow, the critics are so disconnected from reality!
@WallStreetSilv It is for me
@MuskUniversity And Tesla is getting it done
@andst7 Fermi was incredible. 

I like that he cared that we see no evidence of  aliens. It is a fundamental question about the nature of the universe.
@alx @CommunityNotes @GlennKesslerWP Maybe a link under the account name to the list of Community Notes of an account that is frequently posting incorrect information
@jakeshieldsajj Very sorry to hear that. Many people I know have been severely assaulted.

Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately.

Is the city taking stronger action to incarcerate repeat violent offenders @BrookeJenkinsSF?
@Chad_Hurley 🔥 comments
@bennyjohnson @NPR Seems accurate https://t.co/nx5TmJY7GX
@Umbisam Brand is the cumulative perception of a company’s products over time
Summary of argument against AI safety https://t.co/Vmg4yJm22Y
@TitterDaily First I’ve heard about this. Did they identify what content they’re concerned about?
@AdamLowisz @David_Leavitt @BillyM2k Agreed. The moral guiding star should be to stop racism, not replace one form of it with another, as some have done.
@jachiam0 Very true
@David_Leavitt @BillyM2k The rules are consistent. Even though I think you’re awful and I consider Billy Markus to be a friend, he still had to delete his post or be suspended.
@SenSchumer To avoid losing the trust of the American public, it is important that our justice system pursue Democrats and Republicans with equal vigor.

Whichever party most puts justice before nepotism is the one that deserves trust.
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Tesla will continue to use outside litigators, but it’s important to build a powerful litigation team internally, so that we’re not always on the defensive. 

We’ll also go after the Wall St short-sellers, certain law firms &amp; (sometimes) corrupt regulators who are the true evil.
If the Dem Party had a time machine https://t.co/a1QE7JcGLB
@yhazony straing daze theze r
@krishnanrohit True
@alyssamvance 🤣 true
@planet4589 Spending time in deep space doesn’t seem to affect lifespan
@ikristoph @brickroad7 Team is closing the loop on interventions very rapidly. To get enough training examples for potential serious accidents, we have to run them in sim, as we have so few in the fleet, despite doing ~1M miles per day of FSD.
@brickroad7 Yup, happening in plain sight
@cb_doge I’ve been saying this for over a decade
@BillyM2k Very true
@Jason Probably correct
@WholeMarsBlog If we had been allowed to introduce new evidence, the verdict would’ve been zero imo.

Jury did the best they could with the information they had. I respect the decision.
@TheRabbitHole84 Wise words. The technology finally exists to change that.
@andst7 @CommunityNotes Thanks for the correction
@jborg_arts Why would anyone who doesn’t live in New York care about their times!? I’m confused.
@TheRabbitHole84 They voluntarily did exactly what I wanted them to do https://t.co/MqOSLaXk7l
@TheRabbitHole84 It is media’s control of what to write about in the first place that is far more insidious than having some facts wrong in an article
@JoeyMooose Nope
I wish the media would stop flattering me all time … it’s a bit much guys ☺️
@Chad_Hurley Video too
@ShellenbergerMD Interesting

@PeterDiamandis @cb_doge I ate three times body weight in donuts!
@dogeofficialceo Nice
They should really get rid of that 100 IQ maximum limit for creating an account on Instagram
@boringcompany @TUM_Boring Well done!
@ylecun Actually, airplanes used to crash frequently!

Eventually, so many people died that the FAA was created to ensure that commercial aircraft makers &amp; airlines didn’t cut corners on safety. 

Now, flying on an airliner in America is super safe.

https://t.co/WCs2IuMyGb
@andst7 @aagalloni Good question
@Austen @CommunityNotes Critically, Community Notes applies equally to every account on this platform without exception, including world leaders &amp; our biggest advertisers
Credit to Tim Sweeney for realizing this before me
@Austen Once a writer gets Noted a few times, they usually try a lot harder to be truthful, which greatly amplifies the positive effect of @CommunityNotes
@cb_doge True
@Scobleizer Some of the AI art is incredible &amp; it keeps getting better!
@BillyM2k Your feed is great
@SpaceForceCSO @SemperCitiusSDA Thank you for entrusting @SpaceX with this mission
@Reuters “Deceptive headline backfires on Reuters”
@Rainmaker1973 Can I interest you in a tunnel, perhaps? @boringcompany
@buccocapital Whoa
@all_in_tok @DavidSacks @MarkWarner Very concerning
Great interview on AI
@dogeofficialceo @nytimes NY Times is being incredible hypocritical here, as they are super aggressive about forcing everyone to pay *their* subscription
@TesLatino @Tesla FSD is getting really good
@N__1__7 @Rainmaker1973 Yeah, above ground upside down pyramid should connect to an underground pyramid. Would be sick.
Feels like the future
Walked whole Cybertruck production line at Giga Texas for several hours earlier today – gonna be awesome!
@Rainmaker1973 These are great
@unusual_whales True
@TrungTPhan Verification of accounts will help a lot. We are adding date of verification to the profile. 

Note, only date since paid verification counts, since there was so much corruption in the past with legacy checkmarks.
Also, their feed is the Twitter equivalent of diarrhea. It’s unreadable.

They would have far more real followers if they only posted their top articles. 

Same applies to all publications.
@cb_doge $7 is a small price for freedom
@freddiesayers If there were in fact such an epidemic, the White House &amp; every newspaper in the western hemisphere would shout each case from the rooftops!

There isn’t one.
@PeterDiamandis What future do you want?
@JeffTutorials @nytimes This
@ajlamesa Sounds familiar
The real tragedy of @NYTimes is that their propaganda isn’t even interesting
@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy Billionaires suck lol
@alx @GlennKesslerWP @CommunityNotes Tell me this isn’t the best $8 you’ve ever spent 🤣🔥
@cb_doge Oh ok, we’ll take it off then
@slashdot San Francisco cooked its golden geese. Now the Golden State risks doing the same.

Better to collect the golden eggs forever than eat the goose once.
@DrJBhattacharya You were a significant enough to be blacklisted, but allegedly not enough to be verified. They lied. In reality, it was just partisan censorship / propaganda.
@Rainmaker1973 The White House is just a small cottage. We need to move on!
@Rainmaker1973 We should build a new presidential office in the shape of a giant upside down pyramid!

Sure, they’ve built normal pyramids before, but a giant upside down pyramid? That takes advanced technology.
@DavidSacks Our algorithm is obviously horrendous, but it will get better fast and in full view of the public, whose trust we must earn
@DrJBhattacharya @ajlamesa The eagerness of English to add foreign words has contributed greatly to its success!

This is a great podcast: https://t.co/ld0DzE0y7j
@DrJBhattacharya @ajlamesa How much English is used in Italy? We love adding Italian words to our vocabulary!
@DrJBhattacharya If an account is permanently suspended, all its activity is removed
@cb_doge Exactly
@cb_doge A little sugar is fine
@cb_doge Oh … the irony
@EvaFoxU Inspiration for the @boringcompany (not a) flamethrower!
@JanJekielek @boriquagato Agreed
@Supreme_Owl_FTW @ashleevance Extremely concerning, given that it leads to a dystopian future – just walk around downtown SF to see what will happen
@ylecun @erikbryn Aerospace safety is overseen by the FAA, because people had had enough of dying due to shoddy manufacturing &amp; maintenance, but there is no agency overseeing AI at all.
@park2power @Erdayastronaut @WR4NYGov @_BRCooper Geo direct mission
@boriquagato Who is behind these botnets? 

Million dollar bounty if convicted.
@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman I recommend having 1/4 to 1/2 of an epic donut 🍩 It’s diminishing returns after the first few bites.
@SciGuySpace More than days away, but hopefully not many weeks away
@ashleevance You could literally film a Walking Dead episode unedited in downtown SF.

This is where San Francisco politics leads and Twitter was exporting this self-destructive mind virus to the world.

With some exceptions, other tech companies are still doing so. 

Evil in guise of good.
@DavidSacks They know they cannot defend what their algorithm actually does, so they will keep it closed
@PeterDiamandis Ok fine AI should do fashion it’s awesome
@GlennKesslerWP Only thing on fire are Kessler’s pants
@gaborgurbacs Steak is great too!
@GlennKesslerWP “Incendiary” 🤣🤣 🔥🔥
Me after 1 day of not eating sugar https://t.co/BP0dqyvcg1
@MuskUniversity Yeah!!
@cb_doge @PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Somehow, I’m still alive, despite having ice cream since I was a child. It’s a miracle!
@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Sorry, that’s just the donut talking
@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Also, that doc looks pretty old for someone who’s only age 25
@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Sugar is awesome 😎
Wait for it …
This is most of the recommendation code. In the coming weeks, we will open source literally everything that contributes to showing a tweet, such that the output can be at least roughly approximated.
@szymonkopec @petergyang Should be &amp; will be
@ZubyMusic Someone should make a movie about that
@TitterDaily Avoiding dystopian outcomes is not easy. 

The intent is not for the algorithm to be some judgy moral arbiter, but rather that it do its best to inform &amp; entertain.

Trying to maximize unregretted user-minutes seems like the right objective.
@TitterDaily It will
@sterlingcrispin I will die in America (or Mars if lucky)
@BillyM2k Yeah!
Don’t Look Up … but AGI instead of comet
@ylecun According to my biological NNs, AI existential risk to humanity is non-trivial
We live in the most interesting of times
@ylecun You really think AI is a single-edged sword?
@miketx95 @BillyM2k So are we lol
@ShellenbergerMD @ScottPelley @PaulREhrlich Absolutely
@AlexEpstein @ScottAdamsSays @60Minutes @ShellenbergerMD @BjornLomborg @BrianGitt @HumanProgress @RitaPanahi @jordanbpeterson Ehrlich despises humanity. Nothing he says should be given the slightest credibility.
@jordanbpeterson His “Population Bomb” book might the most damaging anti-human thing ever written
@stillgray Mostly accurate tbh
@willdepue lol, but maybe
@gdb Yikes

@TomFitton @CDCgov The CDC?
@stillgray Nice
@farzyness @MartinViecha @Sen_JoeManchin @POTUS This is messed up
@jordanbpeterson Not sure, but after watching some of his talks online, he would not be an obvious choice to play the protagonist in a movie
@lexfridman Good list
@BriannaWu Thanks for paying me $8
@grizzzmint @TheRabbitHole84 Which is, ironically, obviously super racist!
Hope you’re having a great day 1 2023!

One thing’s for sure, it won’t be boring.
@WholeMarsBlog Agreed, update coming in Jan
@jpr007 I’d like to thank the people of Norway again for their incredible support of electric vehicles. Norway rocks!! 🇳🇴
@ScottAdamsSays @Mediaite Yeah, this is silly. I love your work!
@TimRunsHisMouth @ZaleskiLuke Exactly! I am obviously “moderate wing”, except as viewed by the far left.
@pmarca Piketty is a misanthrope
@drefanzor @oadegbolamdphd @fahmialalam On the list
Sometimes it’s just better to make pizza at home
@oadegbolamdphd @fahmialalam Absolutely
@hodgetwins @TheBabylonBee Key test for authenticity is how someone is in live back &amp; forth discussion where canned speeches don’t work, eg Twitter Spaces. Has she done anything like that?
Unlike likes, bookmarks are private
Easy to create folders to bookmark tweets into various categories
Twitter has a bookmark function accessible through share button on tweet. 

To read bookmarks, tap profile icon.

This obscure UI will be fixed in Jan.
@stillgray To the best of my knowledge, I have never met him, nor was I at that Halloween party in Romania
@alex_avoigt Please take both of those sentences fully to heart!
@MuskUniversity Absolutely
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla Megapack (and Powerwall) will make a massive difference to achieving a sustainable energy future for Earth!
@WholeMarsBlog Yup, should be the best deal in town!

@hamoon__ @neuralink Neuralink is working super hard to ensure implant safety &amp; is in close communication with the FDA. If things go well, we might be able to do initial human trials later this year.
If you’ve worked on advanced wearables, phones or robots, those skills are needed @neuralink
Feels weird helping make (hopefully good version of) Cyberpunk come true
Please consider working at Neuralink!

Short-term: solve brain/spine injuries
Long-term: human/AI symbiosis 

Latter will be species-level important 

Work at either at our Bay Area or Austin locations
On Clubhouse tonight at 10pm LA time
@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.
@we5dogg @teslaownersSV No escaping that for me

@DocumentingBTC The dollar is shorting itself
@westcoastbill Indeed
@JohnnaCrider1 @Iupsychdoctor @AOC @RobinhoodApp Shopify is great too. SpaceX used them.
@wimgrommen @WSBChairman Indeed. The economy — making useful products &amp; providing great services — is what actually matters.
@Iupsychdoctor @AOC @RobinhoodApp TANSTAAFL. Would be better to have small fees than no fees, as latter makes Robinhood beholden to big trading houses. Got to pay the bills somehow. Even Etsy has fees.
Here come the shorty apologists
Give them no respect
Get Shorty

@28delayslater Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp; advanced battery work were important precursors.
@PPathole @Grimezsz I made that video!
@AOC @RobinhoodApp Absolutely
@NASASpaceflight Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure. 

Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.
The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw. The interior design is👌.
@teslaownersSV @DMC_Ryan A little
@DMC_Ryan New Roadster is part rocket
@DMC_Ryan @lafebra @Gfilche There’s more storage now &amp; easily upgradable
@24_7TeslaNews @WholeMarsBlog Yeah, probably in a few months
@WholeMarsBlog After you drive without using a PRND stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp; use a shifter!
@WholeMarsBlog No more stalks. Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context &amp; nav map. You can override on touchscreen.

@nextspaceflight We’re hoping for FAA approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to 8 camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving.

@Megaconstellati @Aviation_Intel @jetcitystar @larrypress All sats launched next year will have laser links. Only our polar sats have lasers this year &amp; are v0.9.
@TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @cleantechnica I hope so
@Tesmanian_com These also have laser links between the satellites, so no ground stations are needed over the poles
@teslaownersSV @cleantechnica Sorry for the version confusion. V8.1 is what it should say for FSD. Separate version number for rest of car.
@cleantechnica To my surprise, Tesla has better AI hardware &amp; software than Waymo (money)

@NASASpaceflight Hopefully, early next week
@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight
Launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow. Excited about offering low-cost access to orbit for small companies!
@GerberKawasaki They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something that’s ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy.
@Erdayastronaut It’s a good path for fully renewable rocket energy, so solves part of problem, but longer chain hydrocarbons than CH4 are needed to be solid at room temp

@kellyreid The rate-limiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing
@FrancisSuarez @CityofMiami Cars &amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp; particulate, but @boringcompany road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp; be an example to the world. 

Spoke with @RonDeSantisFL about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it.
@RationalEtienne @OwenSparks_ @Tesla With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made
@lexfridman @tegmark Tegmark is an exceptionally smart &amp; good human
@OwenSparks_ The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food &amp; beverage, some medical (eg syringes) &amp; toys
Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem.
@p_ferragu Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in.

@PPathole I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They’re great places to get spare parts.
@TheBabylonBee A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech
@alexandersibert @signalapp Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.
@benmezrich I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn’t leave time to write books.
@Ragazaga5 @SpacePadreIsle Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year
@SpacePadreIsle The Prancing Pony?
@mayemusk It’s true
@glenn22x @woketopiansa Yes, but not for long
@woketopiansa Yeah, they seemed optimistic too
My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.
@Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That’s actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory
@techreview And increase fun! Hopefully.
@benmezrich Me neither
@TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations
@91demigod No, but maybe one day
@PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.
@engineers_feed His sick beats https://t.co/8PbsgffzRp
@flcnhvy Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.
@Erdayastronaut @lexfridman Or at least the option for verification, so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts
Launch underway
Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)
@engineers_feed Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O —&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.
@engineers_feed Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but that’s more of a long-term solution.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge This will be hard to make, as it isn’t like any other vehicle
@4thFromOurStar Playing the long game
@ashleevance True
@ID_AA_Carmack I hope so. Wings don’t work on the moon at all and def not well on Mars. Also, no runways.

Snow falling on Giga Berlin https://t.co/eTXMtYp8hG
@flcnhvy Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.
So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all.
@newscientist Um, we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance
@comma_ai Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can’t speak for regulators though.
@PPathole Dojo isn’t needed, but will make self-driving better. It isn’t enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.

@Erdayastronaut Might be a few lumps along the way
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission.
@ICannot_Enough @AloysiusFekete @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Exactly
@RexChapman Haha
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @ErcXspace SN9 will press CH4 header tank with helium. Long-term solution is under debate. Not clear what is lightest/simplest.
@RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Legs would certainly work, but best part is no part, best step is no step
@flcnhvy @ErcXspace Saves mass &amp; cost of legs &amp; enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount — ready to refly in under an hour

@richierichhhhh_ Absolutely
What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
@PPathole @WSJ Absolutely
@Tesmanian_com Taste of the future
Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon.
@WSJ Focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future.
@ThatDesignGuy @m_siphiw @moosuraj @Tesla Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique — not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.
@engineers_feed Very important
@teslaownersSV @lexfridman Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check.
@teslaownersSV @lexfridman You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don’t have it?
@GUNMTLM3 @lexfridman No, but definitely this year
@lexfridman Good point
@conexionspacial @spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Interesting
@flcnhvy Liz has always done great interviews
@spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math?
@karpathy Vaccines are just the start. It’s also capable in theory of curing almost anything. Turns medicine into a software &amp; simulation problem.
@TeslaTruckClub @jeremyjudkins @JPUConn @jchybow @DirtyTesla We will offer multiple display options
@IvanEscobosa @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta 10 or 11.
@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV Sure
@kkvr2823 @tesla_adri @teslaownersSV There are subtle, important, differences between US &amp; Canada traffic rules, but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon
@teslaownersSV We need a “match other traffic speed” setting
@stevewoz Definitely
@flcnhvy @h3_extrachars It’s a step in that direction

@heydave7 Good idea
@wintonARK During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.
@wintonARK Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?

@teslaownerssv It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! There’s some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk … ?
Star Light, Star Bright https://t.co/6CeTAZSXCO
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 This is incorrect
@pcgamer But it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good
@pcgamer A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesn’t make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there weren’t level-based item limits in a single-player game.
@cleantechnica I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare
@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.
@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
@picot_john @CyberpunkGame It’s a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
@truth_tesla @Tesmanian_com Perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.
@Tesmanian_com Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world’s most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict.
@Dota2funny1 @CyberpunkGame Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great

@PPathole @ErcXspace @SpaceX *cooling haha
@ErcXspace @SpaceX Ship leeward side will be bare metal, windward will have black, hexagonal heat shield tiles
@SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Agreed, should be preserved in memory of SN8
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Exactly! Woohoo!!
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX SN8 did great! Even reaching apogee would’ve been great, so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic!!
Thank you, South Texas for your support! This is the gateway to Mars.
Life, the Universe and Everything https://t.co/1ZCzInfc4u
@Erdayastronaut Yeah, engines did great!
Mars, here we come!!
Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high &amp; RUD, but we got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!
Successful ascent, switchover to header tanks &amp; precise flap control to landing point!
@wonderofscience Near-orbital space is the fastest way to travel long distance on Earth!
@SpaceX @Space_Station It’s called the Space “Station”, but it’s actually moving around Earth at ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet
“So long, and thanks for the orifice!”
- Alien message decrypted
@SpaceX Probably 1/3 chance of completing all mission objectives
@SpaceX Hopefully flying tomorrow
Out on the pad in South Texas https://t.co/RcYOXXpTc2
@Space_Station @SpaceX Wow, Station looks amazing!
@NASASpaceflight Knock, knock, singing telegram!

Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a “rocket scientist”, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon.
Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe, engineering is about creating things that never existed

@justpaulinelol It does get a bit cold at night
@engineers_feed Paint makes a hell of a difference
@DeepMind Congrats!
@lrocket Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX! Some of the best memories ever.
@RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon
@MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.
@bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights
@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.
@eugenelee3 @PPathole @karpathy Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.
@PPathole @karpathy For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha
@Poppa_BearQ @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round
@dburkland @ID_AA_Carmack Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks
@ID_AA_Carmack fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what we’re betting on for training with Dojo
@ID_AA_Carmack Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
@thisisjendoll But actually! https://t.co/lb14pKsayI
Happy Thanksgiving!
@teslaownerssv @JohnEG78 @TeslaChillMode @UNPLGD3 @MFrunker @ccteslaclub Hopefully next month
@JohnEG78 @TeslaChillMode @UNPLGD3 @MFrunker @ccteslaclub Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically.
@karpathy Haha true
@HumanoidHistory The Promise is greatly needed
@EvaFoxU We will have special colors for new Roadster, as we did for the original
.@TheBabylonBee is savage 🤣🤣
@WorldAndScience If you ever wondered where we came from
This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal
@TesLatino @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Yes, but only slightly filled
@aholstein404 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz This is a subject of much debate
@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15
@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
@thesheetztweetz But that’s why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
@thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance
Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.
@Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
@RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet
@StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
@MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
@PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip We’re still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.
@Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.
@XHNews Exciting mission!
Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You
@JohnnaCrider1 @teslaownerssv @28delayslater Sure
@FutureJurvetson @flcnhvy True
@RationalEtienne @heydave7 @philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point😬.
@RationalEtienne @ShyCybertruck Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy
@flcnhvy Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!
@heydave7 @philwhln Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products
@NASASpaceflight Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Actually, off to the side (so it doesn’t take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Where it should be!
@philwhln @heydave7 Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise it’d be wrong to ask others to do so.
Well, almost anything
Quite the day ahead
@NASAaero @LockheedMartin Now *this* is what you’d call pointy!
@cleantechnica Cool
@Astro_Fonseca @Space_Station @wonderofscience @VirtualAstro They’re moving at ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing
@vicentes @EvaFoxU @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station There will always be upgrades
@EvaFoxU @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
@enn_nafnlaus @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.
@PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Exactly
@mirojurcevic @TashaARK This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with @Space_Station. 

Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you’re going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm.
@PhilippeCROIZON @SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship
@Peter_J_Beck Well done!
@hisdirtremoves @SpaceX I can’t comment on turbopump internal details, but you’re roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
@TashaARK To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.
@IsaacLatterell @TashaARK @karpathy Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej.
@spacetouristuk @TashaARK Yeah. They stole Apple’s code too.
https://t.co/gy4DT7Pq9N

@shifthappends @Tesla A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!
@Astronomiaum Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization – discovering our ruins – will be impressed humans got that far.
@PPathole @xDreamCoding @garyblack00 That is certainly the intention!
@garyblack00 The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla
@garyblack00 Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you don’t.
https://t.co/yHVQJXTahn
@teslaownerssv @AstroJordy @flcnhvy No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL.
@Astronomiaum Life in glass domes at first. Eventually, terraformed to support life, like Earth.
@AstroJordy @flcnhvy Yeah
@Daywalker_xD @Astronomiaum I was going to say “Sim!”, but that seemed too obvious haha
@flcnhvy And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether they’re just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious.
@nichegamer Maybe a little Mercy … https://t.co/9iE40HOihr

@peterrhague It’s designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity! 

Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars.
@Kristennetten @royalsociety More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
@westcoastbill Indeed
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly
@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. 

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.
@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!
@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.
@flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
@ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel 💯 if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I’ve ever had.
@LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain.
@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
@billhuang688 @JohnnaCrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack Maybe *I* just love irony haha

@gaertner_anne @Neuro_Skeptic @DresdenTea @judith_herbers Haha
@michaelmina_lab Great thread
@SamTalksTesla I’m ok, thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. Unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold.
Launch in 5 minutes
@flcnhvy Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other
Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety
@KlotzAdam @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. I’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over.
@PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.
@PPathole @Mario_Livio Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument
Astronaut launch today!
@Mario_Livio No kids though
@Mario_Livio Hell of a wig collection too
@michaelmina_lab It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
Worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing
@stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it’s high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”.
@AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
@michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I’m asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
@teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
@erujabidi Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.

@robintosh_nunez @PPathole Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of today’s test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.
@ICannot_Enough @JohnnaCrider1 What’s honey?

@MrSammy_H @pelagicbird @max_roi @rossy65 Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford 🤣🤣. General public doesn’t realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
@WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
@MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.
Case closed https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6
Soon https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk
@PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable.
@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
@PPathole Strange
@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
@ryaneshea From https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c https://t.co/XTSukcc3Tl
@dana_e_morgan Sure is
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
@ClareCraigPath Interesting
@john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. 

False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo
@justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
@cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
The carousel turns ever faster
@ajtourville Exactly
@JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
@BLKMDL3 If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
@austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
@austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork.

@reganlovetesla @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc Enough already on my plate &amp; Tesla’s. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100X harder.
@amyceskridge Neuralink won’t overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter.
@flcnhvy @PPathole @cleantechnica We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo won’t contribute for about a year. It’s mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark we’re tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or it’s pointless.
@PPathole @cleantechnica Version 1 is about a year away
@RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc It would appear that their calculations were incorrect
@SpaceNews_Inc China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.
@cleantechnica Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important.

@ICannot_Enough @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Yes, although I didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they’re needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
@FutureJurvetson @PPathole Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
@ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
@vincent13031925 @JonErlichman I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
@JonErlichman That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn’t own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.
@PPathole Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge
@itshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year.
@thesheetztweetz Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!
@kjell_arne @flcnhvy Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
@enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy Didn’t realize that was possible. No problem if there’s a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
@flcnhvy As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
@LouisWFerreira New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
@engineers_feed Haha
Very close to actual expected flight!
@Nigel_Lockyer I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I don’t think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.

@Erdayastronaut @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight We’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
@RGVaerialphotos Lord of the …
@TGMetsFan98 @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @TesLatino Every 5 to 10 days
@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @TesLatino Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
@teslaownersSV @TesLatino We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
@TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! 

Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. Reality is the hardest sim.
@auchenberg Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
@teslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions
@teslaownersSV @toadmeister I’ve spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. 

Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement.
@toadmeister And … Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29 https://t.co/b0LyGOtobI
@TOCNewYorkState True. Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.
@MalekKhelifi24 @9inety6Prince @engineers_feed Now we’re talking. Also, Stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha.
@WholeMarsBlog Accurate
@bluemoondance74 @SpacePadreIsle Some challenges with high winds. Looks like Sunday for static fire.
@SpacePadreIsle Great shot!
@EndelSound @Grimezsz Future AI will appreciate this
@Teslarati Truth is stranger than fiction
@homantse28 For a long time
Truth be told, I’ve eaten at JitB many times over the years, even the teriyaki bowl
Might buy a Jack in the Box footstool
@skorusARK Approximately, log(rate)
@challengerST Same bot, just change setting to “combat”
@SamTalksTesla Well, being a phased array antenna, it is actually rather flat!
Tesla should make 🔥 catgirl robots?
@MachinePix Little crane: “Am I just a toy to you!?”
Come here … no, come, here 👇
Wow, this mayo sure is salty!
@PPathole @pcgamer Max Payne was great on many levels. Silent Hill good too.
Jack in the Box should do double duty as a sperm donor clinic — name is 👌
@TheWPMontgomery @pcgamer One of the best games ever
@ThatDudeShannon @pcgamer FEAR 1 with modern graphics &amp; sound would rock
@ZZCOOL @pcgamer All games in this thread are far scarier &amp; more creatively so than any horror movie
@pcgamer FEAR 2 is best imo. Also Dead Space 2. They will haunt your dreams.
@jgrano305 @flcnhvy To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. 

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories.
@flcnhvy All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
@flcnhvy And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
@ajtourville Bettern nothin or ur 💰 back!
@HyperChangeTV Tesla team has done great work!
@HyperChangeTV Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash 😬
@westcoastbill Testing for covid is a license to print money
@arctechinc @Tesla Yes, very helpful. Thanks all beta testers!
@Erdayastronaut Video training &amp; inference is essential for excellent autonomy
@engineers_feed Sigh … there should be a new supersonic jet, this time electric
@WorldAndScience Critical to humanity’s future
Congratulations SpaceX Team!
@TesLatino Mine is a few days ahead
@EliBurton_ @teslaownersSV Sure, it could be an option in settings
@teslaownersSV Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Sure
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ I’m in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
@austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
@WholeMarsBlog Yup. With beta updates, there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
@bart_sanders Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
@SpacePadreIsle Starship is coming together!
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
@austinbarnard45 There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
@DMC_Ryan Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?
@StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires?
@SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
@flcnhvy Sure
Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
@TeslaGong @PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).
@teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Haha
@Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety
@WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).
@Erdayastronaut Cold gas for now, hot later
@Rubix161 I mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar …
Starship nosecone, high bay &amp; tiki bar https://t.co/9qXYxMMIUj
@Erdayastronaut After it gets to orbit a few times
@Erdayastronaut Got a little melty tbh :)
@Erdayastronaut Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything, but I’m confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. 

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.
Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
@PPathole @toadmeister Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
@juanjacobs @jwangARK Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes
@PPathole @flyerandyp @mojosusan Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha.
@flyerandyp @mojosusan Actually, it’s my neck … https://t.co/2vCoAxsrV3
@flyerandyp @mojosusan Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely.
@jwangARK Pretty accurate. It’s not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack.
@SamTalksTesla London to Beijing would be cool
@SamTalksTesla Wow, that would be quite a trip!
@CiNoTpyrC That’s my kid haha
@TechAmazing Looks like snoopy
@Tesmanian_com Current production is slightly better
@bamtheteslaman1 @cleantechnica Doesn’t seem to be any life in this solar system. Maybe under the ice of Europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of Mars. Worth reading:
https://t.co/ym0d53HgyS
@cleantechnica Very creative
@flcnhvy That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts ~4 million tons of mass into energy every second. We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization.
@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV You never know
@PPathole After
@WhatsupFranks @kimpaquette Also, system should autodelete old data automatically by default
@UniverCurious Table in tension
@teslaownersSV Starting production on 7 seater next month, initial deliveries early December
The gauntlet has been thrown down! 

The prophecy will be fulfilled. 

Model S price changes to $69,420 tonight!
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @whoisheartbreak @Erdayastronaut @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceToday1 More great renderings! Significant improvements coming to the welds.
@gem8mingen @Tesla Congratulations!
@Teslarati Making progress
9 meter or roughly 30 ft diameter
Will be less roomy with 3 vacuum rocket engines added https://t.co/pKtDFdiZYC
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla It’s still there, but focus is Vegas &amp; Prufrock, our new tunneling machine
@AstroJordy @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla For sure
@WholeMarsBlog @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.
@Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla We simplified this a lot. It’s basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds.
@PlayOverwatch Sweet …
@antonkanerva Yes. Everything is slow to a phased array antenna.
@lexfridman Nice
“What is love? Baby don’t hurt me.”— Winston Churchill
@PlayOverwatch @twomad Or maybe 2 weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom
@PlayOverwatch @twomad Please buff Torb’s turret!
@twomad Um … yes
@teslaownersSV I have Goosebumps 2 merch. Not sure how tbh.
🤘 The Illuminaughty 🤘
@ChotiHaque @BillGates @DougStanhope @bobdylan @charltonbrooker @EricIdle @JimCarrey @JohnCleese @sapinker Knee deep
@chipro Yeah
@WR4NYGov At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!
@bad_at_life @WholeMarsBlog Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he’s in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.
@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
@Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it’s right.
@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you, much more accurate haha
@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down
@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan
@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.
@shortword @jwangARK The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant
@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
@jwangARK Accurate analysis. Quite a few 
ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements.
@OhioTesla @JenDunlap_ @Tesla @CARandDRIVER @teslaownersSV @Teslarati @ElectrekCo Glad Jen is safe!
@slashdot Uh ok, here we go …
@Teslarati I don’t think this is accurate
@Tesmanian_com Even if half that amount, it’s still a big deal!
@MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JeffBezos @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!
@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.
@flcnhvy Definitely
@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.
@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all.
@Carrenimfa Interesting
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @PelleBrannvall @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX @BocaChicaGal SpaceX/Tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level
@Erdayastronaut I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
@RationalEtienne @toadmeister Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.
@toadmeister Sweden was right https://t.co/bzc2lFDjZQ
@Erdayastronaut @PelleBrannvall @flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX There are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer!
@Teslarati Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
@flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
@Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
@ID_AA_Carmack Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.
@RGVaerialphotos @SpaceX I’m proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
@SDG2030 @anandmahindra @MetniGeorges @ErikSolheim @berniehollywood Norway leads the world
@NASASpaceflight Passed cryo proof
@ajtourville Yeah, it’s not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesn’t work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys.
@Astro_FarmerBob @astro_Pettit @AstroKomrade @AstroAnnimal Great pics!
@johnkrausphotos @Patreon @SuperclusterHQ @SpaceX Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
@TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. 

It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
@RenataKonkoly @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK It should be
@franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
@PicklePunchD @PPathole @TashaARK Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣
@PPathole @TashaARK Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
@TashaARK Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
@akidesir @Kristennetten Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
@ErcXspace @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster.
@Kristennetten Mimecraft
@ICannot_Enough @TeslaTested Autopilot team is making great progress. Reality sure is complicated!
@ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake
@eugenelee3 @MarcusHouseGame @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight We do have giant steel balls haha
@TeslaTested We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one
@IheartTesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog I definitely need to try these tasty cakes &amp; pastries on my next visit!
@MarcusHouseGame @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Mass ratio. Liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane, even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point.
@IheartTesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles. Too bad that place got torn down. It was awesome.
@TribeHoh @SpaceX @WAStateCommerce You’re most welcome!
@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
@alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog That looks tasty!
@tesladri @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog Sandy Munro understands engineering
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
@WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
@WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. 

Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.
@AstroJordy @WholeMarsBlog They are
@WholeMarsBlog I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
@PPathole @klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley 7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. We’ll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest.
@klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking
@Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley One of the best shots ever!
@SamTalksTesla @SpaceX Much sooner
@mdcainjr @SpaceX @45thSpaceWing @NASA Great photo!
@DirtyTesla @SpaceX It will soon
@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
@alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.
4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe.
@SciGuySpace It’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.
Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla 

https://t.co/l07Yc02P7g
@teslaownersSV FSD will solve these issues
Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11, because it’s louder than 10

@Kristennetten @flcnhvy One of my favorite writers. Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential.
Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend. Still awesome. Ovaltine? https://t.co/WiMdyFSuiq
@flcnhvy The remake has the potential to be great. I kinda liked the original tbh, but it’s possible to take it up a level.
Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials
@cleantechnica This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term
@SamTalksTesla @teslaownersSV @PPathole @RationalEtienne @stevenmarkryan @Kristennetten @WholeMarsBlog Pretty wild, considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago
New SpaceX droneship will be called “A Shortfall of Gravitas”
Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)

Call of Booty, great game
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Vector-space bird’s eye view coming with FSD
@PPathole @SpaceX Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All of that and more. We’re doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range &amp; regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person.
@alandail @SpaceX Exactly
@SpaceX We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!
@lexfridman I agree with Lex
@Mike94160775 @Tesla @ElectrekCo @Teslarati Glad you’re ok!
@Sofiaan @Tesla Haha
@amoghbhushan @TeslaClubIN @WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Thanks for waiting!
@TeslaClubIN @WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Next year for sure
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
@RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
@SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Great
@William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity — needs several more Starlink launches. I’m using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
@PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we’re able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
@RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn’t required for Mars, so 4 is possible
@thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
@WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Yeah
@AdlanBogatyryov @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we’re actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.
@MKBHD It’s next-level
@officialalishap @flcnhvy @Tesla Glad to hear your Mom is ok

@ErcXspace @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
@Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT That’s very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? It’s designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
@FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT It’s cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)
@austinbarnard45 Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships

@ValaAfshar @Tesla Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
@vm_one1 @waEMD @SpaceX We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.
@PerezShivam @waEMD @SpaceX Fate loooves irony haha
@waEMD @SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
@austinbarnard45 True
@teslavibes That’s total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution.
@CathieDWood @skorusARK Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.
@flcnhvy @CathieDWood Both will do original cars
@CathieDWood We aren’t cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
@brian_heide @Tesla What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?
@Pickenheim @matthew_kerle New version coming soon
@WholeMarsBlog Suppliers. We’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard.

@flcnhvy @Kristennetten Checking into it
@Kristennetten Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool
@ID_AA_Carmack Completely agree
@Erdayastronaut Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
@ScottAdamsSays There are times when I feel like I’m living in a Dilbert cartoon
@ArtifactsHub That species has stood the test of time
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, we’re making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.
@NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It’s enough. Improvements in work.
@PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach.
First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft
Nosecone &amp; front flaps next week. SN9 next month.

@EvaFoxU Something like this https://t.co/NDVuUmms67
@ajtourville Can’t support 3 wheel vehicles. Not safe enough.
@MarlonSIX60 Something appealing about Hawking/Hartle idea, but I agree with Turok/Feldbrugge/Lehners
@PPathole @MarlonSIX60 True
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut There are some practical size constraints too. Can’t be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Doesn’t seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.
@DJSnM Preburners ignite, then main chamber
@MarlonSIX60 Where is our prediction of probability inaccurate?
@MarlonSIX60 Or energy &amp; time, but besides that what?
@podcastnotes Genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus
What can’t we predict?
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut Yeah, but might not need it

@FutureJurvetson @hiromichimizuno Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times!
@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog We will be a little below that this year (most challenging year we’ve ever had), but probably above that next few years
@WholeMarsBlog That’s about right. Maybe a little faster.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @CARandDRIVER @Tesla Haha
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Haha
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
@EvaFoxU Thanks!
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship. They’re coming.
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.
@Model3Owners Fine, we’ll do it already 😀
@ARKInvest @TashaARK Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature
@singing__surfer I’m pretty sure Tesla could do a much better autocorrect. The bar is so low haha.
@LorenzoTeixeir4 @Zog_Fot_Pik @samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack True
@IgorAntarov @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling
@flcnhvy @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Pretty much any machine-learning
@jgrano305 @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack It’s big
@Zog_Fot_Pik @samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack Sure
@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
@samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
@llamaa35079089 @ID_AA_Carmack @Tesla You really want waypoints this much?
@ID_AA_Carmack For Dojo, we’re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.
@WholeMarsBlog There’ll be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The “open” areas inside are covered. They’re internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building.

@teslaownersSV @Model3Owners @TrungTPhan Felt I had done enough on the Internet (Zip2 &amp; PayPal) that my work would be useful to others. Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary.
@Model3Owners @TrungTPhan It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero
@TrungTPhan To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me.
@fermatslibrary Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
of course I still love you
@DeborahPatteri @TENETFilm Sure, but which planet?
@TENETFilm Good movie
@Erdayastronaut Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions.
@ChrisDungeon Lot has happened in 13 years
@Teslarati It will be very insane
Speedrunning Factorio in real life …
@cleantechnica No, but you make some great points. Important to note that iron’s cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.

The @BoringCompany
@jackfarrington For sure
@jackfarrington @Tesla Good point
Have you hugged a tunnel today?
@ARKInvest @aurmanARK Good analysis
@PPathole Exactly
@flcnhvy Gary the snail is still winning, but we’re gaining on him/her
@ValaAfshar Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for New York or Beijing.
@MatthewCable6 @ErcXspace Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We’ll build several ships just to improve the production system.
@ErcXspace Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration.
@teslavibes Couldn’t agree more — major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming
@cleantechnica Definitely not. Smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterday’s technology, Neuralinks are the future.

@PPathole @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Cumulative mass to orbit per year (corrected for GTO &amp; other high energy orbits) is the best comparative metric imo
@PPathole @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX That’s the number that really matters
@_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles?
One way or another, excitement guaranteed! Support of greater Boca, Padre, Brownsville community is very much appreciated.
SN8 Starship with flaps &amp; nosecone should be done in about a week. Then static fire, checkouts, static fire, fly to 60,000 ft &amp; back.
@SpacePadreIsle @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Can someone do a boat service from South Padre to Boca?
@WhatsupFranks @samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
@PPathole @WholeMarsBlog Yes. Good insight.
@samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) &amp; then creating video segments for labeling &amp; training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten.
@WhatsupFranks @brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Much
@brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks.
@WholeMarsBlog And this still isn’t using the dramatically better “4D” (aka simultaneous surround video from 8 cameras) architecture
@C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @MarcusHouseGame Cool
@richardreinariv He has no clue
@Astra Sorry to hear that. I’m sure you’ll figure it out though. Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard.

@CharlieMunger00 @UniverCurious Munger is right
@UniverCurious Black-Scholes formula is kinda bs. Big difference between a finance approximation &amp; fundamental physics / pure math.
@wintonARK True
@DisruptResearch Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups, mostly in series, increasingly in parallel. Every product line &amp; new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else, create new pieces.
@DisruptResearch Tesla R&amp;D productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent
Tesla Model S &amp; X have hospital-grade (HEPA) air filters. 3 &amp; Y are really good too. This has a big effect on health. https://t.co/48s5D3IfWs
@RBReich All Tesla workers also get stock, so their compensation increased proportionately. You are a modern day moron.
@Teslarati Rawlinson didn’t design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined &amp; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough, which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @SpaceX We’re pretty close to the manufacturing size limit for a milled copper &amp; steel jacket nozzle. Lot of complexity to add a nozzle extension to a sea level engine for small gain. Also hard to fit bigger engine nozzles on the booster.
@harsimranbansal Haha
@BnOrdhaug And starts tweeting
If you bombard Earth with enough photons, eventually it emits a Tesla (AK)
@ID_AA_Carmack There is already bidirectional communication between human &amp; AI via phones &amp; computers. It’s just lossy &amp; very slow (especially output)
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @SpaceX Above 50% likely to make it
@PPathole @SpaceX This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal.
@SpaceX Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.
@skorusARK Chart understates lithium-ion potential by roughly 1/3

@Nigel_Lockyer @Penn @Fermilab Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation
@SamTalksTesla @Teslarati If some company has solved a useful thing that we can just buy, that would be great! It’s so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to.
@Teslarati Tesla Germany designed &amp; built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too

@ruskin147 It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard.
@l_vaux @kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.
@PPathole @kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I’m headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.
@tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells https://t.co/z9WlvIjoTw
@PPathole @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Yeah
@kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.
@tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.
@WholeMarsBlog @MarcusHouseGame @Neopork85 @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @SpaceToday1 @ElonsWorld @FelixSchlang @ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Not yet
@MarcusHouseGame @Neopork85 @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @SpaceToday1 @ElonsWorld @FelixSchlang @ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.
@Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That’s probably faster.
@waitbutwhy Now I want candy
@dauqhx @universal_sci There’s a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It’s solvable.
@universal_sci Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
@jchybow @jwangARK @wintonARK It’s almost working reliably
@jwangARK @wintonARK Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
@jwangARK @wintonARK Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
@tesla_addicted @Erdayastronaut No &amp; not possible at this scale
@Erdayastronaut Orbital launch mount
@NASASpaceflight Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.
@schristakos @skorusARK Sure
@shortword On it
@coach23life I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!
@skorusARK 400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years.

@TeslaTested That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight We will push for ten flights with Starlink
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
@Erdayastronaut @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Mostly for employees, but we’ll support public access whenever it’s safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Absolutely 😃 🏝
@Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
@cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 I’ve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
@ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Dojo V1.0 isn’t done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
@Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
@nextspaceflight Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you’re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3
@zubinanary @SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages Yes, it will have huge nuts haha
@Teslarati We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!
@SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.
Aloha, welcome back from space 💫 https://t.co/xWPN09Wtaw
@Erdayastronaut Yeah, will post shortly
@krystof_mitka @BiIndia Winning “worst person I’ve ever worked with” is not easy. Some real champions are vying for that title!
Ms Tree catches fairing in her net https://t.co/sqlJ63NetB
@valleyhack @GeoffdBarrett Up there somewhere, cruising through deep space https://t.co/PcybhfpUAD
@NatGeo Must be aliens
@RGVaerialphotos @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut This little spit of dirt will take us to Mars
@jwangARK Humans are swiftly becoming a small percentage of total compute
@Erdayastronaut @ProgrammerDude Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.
@justpaulinelol @NASASpaceflight That’s engine SN. We’re building SN8 of the ship.
@NASASpaceflight SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! https://t.co/kVKRWksvaB
@Erdayastronaut Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights.
@C_Bass3d @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.
@PPathole @universal_sci This might sting a little …
@PPathole The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years.
@universal_sci Also, there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just haven’t observed them during humanity’s (very short) recorded history. Comet S-L 9 punched a roughly Earth-sized hole in Jupiter. https://t.co/ne7DM0YAXX
@universal_sci Pretty much
Cybertruck option package
@Booster_Buddies @NASASpaceflight My button-twiddling makes no sense at all 🤣🤣

@EuricSanti @luisabinader @Tesla Thank you, Tesla is most honored!
@CowderySedge @tbdnonymous Very real possibility
Please trash me on Wikipedia, I’m begging you
History is written by the victors … except on Wikipedia haha
@nickcappelli @Grimezsz Cover of Barbie Girl
@tbdnonymous Yes. Probably more accurate to say Great Filters plural.
@nickcappelli @Grimezsz Yes, it’s called Cyber Girl
We must pass The Great Filter
Sounds right https://t.co/dm76FJq3hX
@Dr_rami @tomdestella @RobertDowneyJr Seriously
@long_elon Crysis rocks
A truly useful exaflop at de facto FP32
@Kristennetten @engineers_feed Metal has a fudge-like consistency near its melting point, so you can just smoosh it together
@engineers_feed This is how we make Falcon 9
@flcnhvy @ICannot_Enough @Tesla This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators.
@realwillreil @GiulioCoraggio 🤣🤣 hasty govt 🤣🤣
@teslaownersSV @PPathole @ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla A lot of work remains. Technically, we have it working in sim with FPGAs at ~0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer.
@PPathole @ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla Dojo is still being built. Maybe a year or so from V1.0.
@ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not.
@ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla Your insights over the years have been excellent. That’s approximately right.
@GiulioCoraggio Absolutely, but it doesn’t seem that govt can move fast enough
@flcnhvy It will blow ur mind haha https://t.co/LqnKEN5Kjn
@tomdestella I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload
@universal_sci Asteroid impact risk is well understood, but not comets. Those worry me.
Great mission patch design!
@Nikola_Truth Haha true
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV Exactly
@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn’t have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily.
@vicentes @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.
@_bennettm_ @Erdayastronaut Yes! We’re labeling bumps &amp; potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so.
@Erdayastronaut This is what I meant by “4D” https://t.co/xpX7j5SnPy
@Erdayastronaut The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks.
Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It’s a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
@Teslarati More software improvements coming
@cleantechnica Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling &amp; ride comfort &amp; enable user customization of height &amp; damping, geocoded for relevance.
@stoolpresidente H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel
@waitbutwhy @lukeprog What are the odds … ?
@viktaur27 @Teslarati The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point.
@Teslarati Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
@Erdayastronaut Impressive
@Erdayastronaut @KenKirtland17 @torybruno @ulalaunch @SpaceX @blueorigin @DJSnM @ThePrimalDino Yes, integrated with the tip of the nose
@Teslarati This is important
@Erdayastronaut Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term. https://t.co/tEE4LDTdYG
@KenKirtland17 @torybruno @ulalaunch @SpaceX @blueorigin @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @ThePrimalDino Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter &amp; more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
@pantsbobsponge @andyjstanton @TimFernholz You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
@TimFernholz So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
@TimFernholz Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd …
@Tesmanian_com I generally try my best not to be on patents
@TimFernholz Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; “space power”. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money.
@WholeMarsBlog Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails.
@renarddemoscou @BillGates Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
@Teslarati No surprise
@Teslarati Aiming to make it super fun!
@Teslarati A little toastier each flight
@flcnhvy Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending.
SN7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. SN8 will have body flaps &amp; nosecone.
SN 5 &amp; 6 at Starship Production Complex in Texas https://t.co/8BVRD5VdU7
@Mark_Goldberg_ @Tesla One day soon, I will wear this outfit https://t.co/T0SnF4UgYK
@Mark_Goldberg_ @Tesla I was trying to channel Herb Tarlek from WKRP https://t.co/0RC72S0ZAY
@Mark_Goldberg_ @Tesla Note the fabulous plaid jacket &amp; gingham shirt combo 🤣
@archillect Twin Peaks
@SamTalksTesla Working on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan at age 17. I think we did a barn-raising that day.
@Erdayastronaut Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg &amp; other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple &amp; easy — many per day.
@lexfridman Clearly
@ramacvr @Kristennetten @PPathole @BernieSanders Also true
@PPathole @BernieSanders Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3.
@RationalEtienne @BernieSanders I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
@BernieSanders And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when we’re doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news? https://t.co/34tzBk5TIv
@BernieSanders That bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil! https://t.co/WmzJnoTFzI
@WR4NYGov @BernieSanders Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies.
@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height.
@Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
@NASASpaceflight It will look crazy tall with booster &amp; fairing at 122m / 394 ft
@TimothyBuffett @Teslarati Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right
Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
@FutureJurvetson @SpaceX This seems increasingly likely
@Teslarati This is gonna be great
@PPathole @TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica We’ll do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps
@ebelardo73 @bluemoondance74 @TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica Soon
@TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller — like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling.
@flcnhvy Progress is accelerating
@SciGuySpace Exactly
@austinbarnard45 Mars is looking real
@TrevorMahlmann Possible flight in 3 mins
@Erdayastronaut Most likely
@flcnhvy @Lindw0rm @cleantechnica True
@Lindw0rm @cleantechnica Highly likely down the road
@cleantechnica True fact
@NASASpaceflight Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didn’t open, triggering an automatic abort. We’ll figure out why &amp; retry tomorrow.
@Erdayastronaut I’m in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX For sure
@engineers_feed Tbh, I must confess to occasionally pontificating about high-concept things
@engineers_feed Pretty much
@Erdayastronaut Nosecone closing is recommended, but not required, for safe entry
When space travel becomes as common as air travel, the future of civilization will be assured
@waitbutwhy Space is the new air
Congratulations @SpaceX &amp; @NASA on completing first crewed Dragon flight!! 🇺🇸 returned.

@georgezachary There is considerable conflation of diagnosis &amp; contraction of “corona”. Actual virality is much lower than it would seem. I think this will turn out to be comparable to other forms of influenza. World War Z it is not.

@Erdayastronaut @Blamblas @latimes @SpaceX @blueorigin Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel.
@thirdrowtesla This number won’t leave me alone! 🤣🤣

@jeff_foust @SciGuySpace Ok, not so bad
@SciGuySpace Who is hating on ISRU &amp; why? Doesn’t make sense.

@IheartTesla @EvaFoxU @Tesla Going with nomenclature of Giga [most widely understood location name] vs Giga #, so Giga Shanghai, Giga Nevada, Giga New York &amp; Giga Berlin
@IheartTesla @EvaFoxU @Tesla For sure. Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy, so net environmental impact will be extremely positive!
@Kristennetten @EvaFoxU @Tesla Exactly!
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won’t use this much net water on a daily basis. It’s possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event. Also, this is not a natural forest — it was planted for use as cardboard &amp; only a small part will be used for GF4.
@Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @Tesla V3 Supercharger deployment will accelerate considerably this year
@Everman @Erdayastronaut Yeah, system should adapt to most likely destination &amp; anticipate school, then work, if that’s owner preference
@Everman @Erdayastronaut Definitely
@SciGuySpace We should have a base on the moon, a city on Mars

@jm_marchante @kekai What should we change?
@kekai Munro’s analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate, both pro &amp; con. I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design.
@Erdayastronaut @SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Even more important for a a reusable rocket, as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant &amp; anything below T/W of 1 is wasted fuel &amp; oxygen
@jameslin123321 @Erdayastronaut Helping to pay for this is why I’m accumulating assets on Earth.
@jameslin123321 @Erdayastronaut Loading the Mars fleet into Earth orbit, then 1000 ships depart over ~30 days every 26 months. Battlestar Galactica …
@mstrwilliam00 @Erdayastronaut Aiming for 20 to 30 years, like aircraft
@Kristennetten @PicklePunchD @Erdayastronaut Yes. There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!
@PicklePunchD @Erdayastronaut Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who don’t have money
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
@Erdayastronaut That’s the goal
@Erdayastronaut Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
@Erdayastronaut Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit
Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
@fighteer1 @LCS_Big_Mike @SciGuySpace That’s about right
@g33st111 Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
@SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy.
@SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!
@Teslarati Sorry, migh have brought the site down

@nntaleb Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically &amp; certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
@ErlendMoberget @ramez @KHayhoe Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun.
@Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant 🔭 in orbit &amp; on moon. With an occluder, could image 🌏 in other star systems.
@Neuro_Skeptic One person’s MRI machine is another’s railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
@Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Exactly. We’ve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, we’ll make sure Starlink doesn’t inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky.

@ramez @KHayhoe Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area that’s *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!

@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.

@PPathole That’s when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took 4.5 billion years to get to this point &amp; civilization isn’t looking super stable.

@BnOrdhaug @yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini That’s the plan. We’re taking a little  risk there, as engine isolation was done as retrofit, so not as good as on Booster 9.
@yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Late next month maybe, but November seems highly likely. We will have two boosters &amp; ships ready for orbital flight by then, with full stack production at roughly one every two months.
@thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Our focus is on reliability upgrades for flight on Booster 7 and completing Booster 9, which has many design changes, especially for full engine RUD isolation.

@teslaownersSV Lot of people still don’t realize Tesla makes uninterruptible power supplies for your whole home (Powerwall)

@da5is This thread brings back a lot of memories
@ev_australia @Tesla @SawyerMerritt @EvaFoxU @miku919191 @tesla_adri @PPathole @TeslaHype @TeslaDiva99 @teslaownersau @techAU We have since improved it further
@WholeMarsBlog The primary solution to a sustainable energy future is solar/wind with batteries for when sun doesn’t shine or wind doesn’t blow, interconnected with conventional high voltage lines. No unknown technology is needed!

Hydro+geothermal+fission will also be non-trivial contributors.
@WholeMarsBlog Fusion would be expensive energy, given difficulty of obtaining and transporting source fuel, plus maintaining the reactor. 

Far better to use the Sun – thermonuclear reactor with no need to refuel or service.
@chicago_glenn Only 64 squares, no fog of war, no tech tree, only a few different pieces,no random spawn. Chess is a simple game. I prefer Polytopia.
@Techmeme @pkafka Interesting …
“That’s not punny!”
@WholeMarsBlog More solar + batteries needed. Batteries are great at dealing with peak demand.
@lexfridman I accept 99% of cookies, but 💯 if choc chip
@garyblack00 If Twitter put as much effort into bot/spam removal as they do into subpoenas, we wouldn’t have this problem in the first place!
@garyblack00 We have advised all potential witnesses to provide full cooperation to the court, but we do not control their actions
@garyblack00 Read the actual ruling. We had zero to do with David Sack’s response. Zero.
@musicphantom69 Those who claim any criticism of Rings of Power means you’re racist are outing themselves as closet racists
@joshcarlosjosh Peter Jackson did excellent work with Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit was stretched too long for a short book.
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla For now, supply is too low, but ordering a Powerwall by itself should be possible end of year
@Teslarati @JohnnaCrider1 Cool
Order a Tesla Powerwall battery for blackout protection! https://t.co/tEE4LDBD78

@WholeMarsBlog Release of 10.69.2 probably end of week. Needs a bit more polish.
Tolkien is turning in his grave
@WholeMarsBlog 10.69.2 has a relatively small number of code changes, but their practical effect will be significant
@SpaceX More Starlinks reach orbit
@andst7 It will probably help proportionate to the cost of raising children
@andst7 Important. South Korea is currently tracking to lose about half its population roughly every generation. Long lifespan hides the dire nature of the problem.
@cb_doge .@Chrisrock invited me to open for one of his shows. Thanks Chris! I will try not to flounder too much.
@sirxapex @SciGuySpace Yes, also very important
@SciGuySpace Accurate assessment. Raptor design started out using H2, but switched to CH4. Latter is best combo of high efficiency &amp; ease of operation imo.

Delta-v difference between H2 &amp; CH4 is small for most missions, because CH4 tank is much smaller &amp; no insulation is needed.
@heydave7 Moody’s is irrelevant
@Michaelgr1011 @LAPDHQ @RickCarusoLA @ericgarcetti @MayorOfLA @lapdVanNuysDiv Hope Connor is ok!

@SciGuySpace Yeah, aiming for up to 100 flights next year
Now launching every ~5 days
@WholeMarsBlog @jonbbc @aelluswamy 10.69.2 goes out to 100k owners next week
Spent the day walking entire Giga Berlin production line – team is doing excellent work!
@jonbbc @WholeMarsBlog @aelluswamy 10.69.1 is even better. We reduced latency &amp; jitter in hardware command loop, so time from object detection to brake actuation is 10% to 20% better.
Kickass Internet connection coming Royal Caribbean ships soon!
@MuskUniversity It’s true
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Ancient times
@teslaownersSV It will grow by at least 5 to 10 meters over time
@WholeMarsBlog First few days, just 1k owners, but going to 10k if no major issues. 

Note, 10.69.2, hopefully going out week after this, is the wide release beta.
@MuskUniversity Good to ask yourself this often
@CSI_Starbase Agreed, we recently made this change &amp; many others.

An intense effort is underway to achieve robust engine containment in case of RUD to protect booster, other engines &amp; launch ring.

@ICannot_Enough It is safe to say that our output will not exceed the mass of the known universe
@ID_AA_Carmack Similarly high cycle life with nickel cathode is possible if optimizing for that.

Adding silicon to (primarily carbon) anode, which improves energy density, reduces cycle life, due to large volumetric changes during charge/discharge.
@BillyM2k True
@MatchasmMatt @jasondebolt @heydave7 That, plus pessimism about the future / false overpopulation fears
(And I do think global warming is a major risk)
Mark these words
Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming

@teslaownersSV 10.69.1 releases Monday night. 10.69.2 about a week or so later – this will be the wide beta version.
@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Ron Barron is awesome
@WholeMarsBlog @RealDanODowd 🦇 💩 crazy
@BBC_Future I would gladly obey their commands, but I can’t tell what they’re saying!
@RationalEtienne @arctechinc I do not doubt that. Criticism, public or private, is welcome after we go to wide beta. 

Early beta has many known issues. The reason we release it to a limited number of cars is to discover unknown issues.
@RationalEtienne @arctechinc No. Let me make something clear: James contacted me directly to be included in *early* beta, which is only ~1000 cars, mostly employees. 

Early beta explicitly has issues or it would be rolled out widely, so publicly criticizing something he had asked for is wrong.
This is something special
The course of civilization is not always upward https://t.co/8mr7pFWcnI
@heydave7 True
Mechazilla loads Starship on launchpad https://t.co/LfkfjpAcZj
@arctechinc 10.69 is in limited release for a reason. Please do not ask to be included in early beta releases and then complain.

@AlliyahsimsTV Yet another “verified”🤖
@ID_AA_Carmack You’re waking up in the morning!?
Neuralink progress update show &amp; tell on October 31 st (Halloween)
2 main goals this year: 

- Starship to orbit
- FSD wide release

Many other things, of course, but those are the 2 giant kahunas. Will require insane work by many super talented people, but, if anyone can do it, they can. 

It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings.
It is the fastest way to get between one downtown and another with known physics (and the Standard Model is proving quiet resilient)!
Would be cool to do a (much simplified) Hyperloop demo tunnel between maybe Austin &amp; San Antonio?
Now @boringcompany tunnels are in active use in Vegas. Try it if you’re in town. Will be expanding to connect all major destinations in Vegas plus airport.
Funny how there are often simultaneous reactions saying “it’s impossible” and “it was already done 3000 years ago”
@chazman @aelluswamy Glad it’s working out! Thanks for giving us this tough case to solve. That’s what field testing is all about.

This early version of 10.69 is being extra cautious, so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross. Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic.
@chazman @aelluswamy Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible.
Note, you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app
After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th. 

Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th, but delivered later.
FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward!

10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release.

1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants.
@BLKMDL3 @Tesla Tesla Autopilot/AI team did great work with 10.69! Some point releases needed for polish, so 10.69.2 should really shine.
@aelluswamy Worth hearing about Tesla Autopilot software/AI progress
@WholeMarsBlog As mentioned previously, this is a major release, so we need to be cautious. Goes out to ~1000 Beta participants later today.
Might need a new PO Box after tweeting this 🤣

@teslaownersSV @CChomp13 There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout.

Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback &amp; release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after &amp; release to rest of FSD Beta.
@CChomp13 Entropy
@Andst7 Those are the questions that Twitter is doing everything possible to avoid answering …
@SawyerMerritt @ICannot_Enough Modifying your car after delivery is legal in America, so yes 😀
@ICannot_Enough That said, we will add autoconfigure to side mirrors
@ICannot_Enough Side mirrors cause ~5% range reduction at highway speed
@ICannot_Enough Yes, but side mirrors won’t be needed in a self-driving future

@PPathole @Andst7 Good question, why aren’t they?
@cb_doge Somehow I have 54 followers
@Andst7 Good summary of the problem. 

If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms.

However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.

WSJ should be running stories that actually matter to their readers and have solid factual basis, not third-party random hearsay.
@heydave7 @WholeMarsBlog @WSJ WSJ has run so many bs hit pieces on me and Tesla I’ve lost count! It’s embarrassing for them, frankly.

They once wrote an article saying FBI was about to arrest me, so I called FBI to ask what’s up and they said WSJ article was total bs.

@karpathy True. I have a CO2 monitor on my desk. It beeps whenever ppm&gt;1000.
@SpaceX @Space_Station About twice as much useful mass to orbit as rest of Earth combined
@tanayj Absolutely
@Erdayastronaut @LevEakins More accurate word is “propellant”, rather than “fuel”. Starship is ~78% liquid oxygen, ~22% fuel.

Propellant cost is of primary importance for a fully reusable rocket, so reusable rockets want high thrust, as thrust below T/W of 1 is irrelevant.
@Rainmaker1973 I use this example a lot
@TJ_Cooney @SpaceX Starlink bandwidth varies a lot, depending on user terminal density &amp; time of day. That’s why the long wait in some areas.

Throughput is roughly linear with total V1 satellites in operation. V2 satellites are at least 5 times better (conservative estimate) than V1.

@hohocho If inflation calms down, we can lower prices for cars
Tesla is to protect life on Earth,
SpaceX to extend life beyond.
@PPathole 20 to 30 years from first human landing if launch rate growth is exponential.

Mars may be a fixer upper of a planet, but it has great potential!
@tim_ottawa @teslaownersSV Mars is, admittedly, a fixer upper of a planet
@teslaownersSV The scale is 🤯 &amp; anyone can visit!
@waitbutwhy I wonder if there is a species in the Magellanic Clouds wondering who lives in the big galaxy they orbit
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Some small tubes &amp; wiring need to be nested in a bigger tube for thermal protection, kinda like conduit in a house. 

Engines themselves &amp; booster base are extremely robust. High strength stainless steel is bulletproof to a handgun at ~2.5mm thickness. Booster dome is 4mm.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Electric power for booster &amp; ship is needed even when engines aren’t running &amp; incremental power draw of TVC isn’t too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons, all things considered.

Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud, forming a MOX bomb.

Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.

Raptors in production now have electric TVC, saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster.
Dragon launching in 2 mins
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Most importantly, we need to delete or thermally protect remaining secondary structure, so we can remove shrouds
@arctechinc 10.13 goes to internal beta tomorrow, external next week. Should handle Chuck’s complex left turn.

Beta v11 hopefully end of next month, which just amounts to incorporating highway. Importance of “v11” has been reduced by all the 10.x releases. We’re already mostly at v11.
@karpathy Thanks for everything you have done for Tesla! It has been an honor working with you.

@ChrisDungeon @alexkehr @BillyM2k @levie Rereading The Life of Greece by Durant. In recent months, read American Caesar, Masters of Doom, Not Much of an Engineer, Wages of Destruction and Storm of Steel.

@alexkehr @BillyM2k @levie I do recommend a lot of books
@levie And too many little red or green LED indicators
@BillyM2k @levie YouTube keeps playing me the same annoying scam ads every time I use it. The algorithm is convinced that I can “make money through Audible” …
@PPathole @planet4589 @NASASpaceflight That is one of the things we will be doing going forward.

This particular issue, however, was specific to the engine spin start test (Raptor has a complex start sequence). 

Going forward, we won’t do a spin start test with all 33 engines at once.
@adamirvinmusic @BreitbartNews Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America.

If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win – he doesn’t even need to campaign.
@JoeTalkShow @BreitbartNews Yeah, but too much drama. Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!?

Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.
@BreitbartNews I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat &amp; sail into the sunset.

Dems should also call off the attack – don’t make it so that Trump’s only way to survive is to regain the Presidency.
Tesla’s automatic cabin overheat protection should make a real difference with record heatwaves.

Ability to adjust activation temperature coming with next software release.
@BonginoReport Not true
@planet4589 @NASASpaceflight Cryogenic fuel is an added challenge, as it evaporates to create fuel-air explosion risk in a partially oxygen atmosphere like Earth.

That said, we have a lot of sensors to detect this. More later.
@NASASpaceflight Yeah, actually not good. Team is assessing damage.

Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. 

A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.

You, the people, must be the media, as it is the only way for your fellow citizens to know the truth.
@shortmagsmle Absurd and unacceptable behavior
The Labour minister for child welfare shields the predators and their anti-corruption minister is corrupt 🤨
Lawfare needs to stop. 

Instead of fighting real crime, under the Democrats, citizens are prosecuted, while serious criminals run free. 

In fact many of the criminals are in the government. At least for another 5 days.

Exactly, article misses the point. 

Fire breaks, brush clears and plenty of water won’t stop all houses from burning down, but the situation would be vastly  improved if those things were done.
Yes. Please be careful in some areas, as there is non-zero risk of armed looters.

Or when Starmer sent British Labour Party members to campaign in the US against President Trump this year?

https://t.co/5R28WgZIj0
@matteosalvinimi @SpaceX This will be great. Other countries in Europe will ask to borrow it.

@BoredJamesBored @visegrad24 Exactly
What an insane thing to say! 

The real reason is that it would show how Starmer repeatedly ignored the pleas of vast numbers of little girls and their parents, in order to secure political support. 

Starmer is utterly despicable.
@Rob_2628 Congrats! 

Gets a bit repetitive in the high 90’s. Many hours of rifts.
@jonatanpallesen Utterly unacceptable
Starmer was deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes. 

That’s what the inquiry would show.

True
Jimmy Saville, longtime BBC employee, raped over 400 children while being paid millions by the BBC
They are devaluing the Presidential Medal of Freedom even faster than the dollar!

Didn’t think that was possible.
The Labour Party opposes a national inquiry on the mass rape of little girls in Britain for one reason only: 

It will show that they were complicit.
The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.
@DefiantLs That contemptible worm posing as a judge should be thrown out and face criminal charges
Are these numbers accurate, @CommunityNotes?
You don’t hate the media enough. Especially, state propaganda arms like the BBC.

@PPathole @Tesla That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve – last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.
@cyantist It was a shamefully low blow from WSJ
@WholeMarsBlog And many other things
@davidjkon @Tesmanian_com No, that’s some tool with senior editor privileges who keeps putting that there
@Tesmanian_com “History is written by the victors” except on Wikipedia, as your enemies are still alive &amp; have lots of time on their hands 🤣🤣
@Tesmanian_com My wiki is such a dumpster fire 🤣🤣. That’s how you know it isn’t curated.
@GerberKawasaki A lot will be added
Tesla holiday software update goes to wide release today!
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is technically a car like an iPhone is technically a phone
10.8 looks good, rolling out today
@BLKMDL3 Good idea
@BillyM2k @jack @gladstein @rahilla @farokh @samkazemian @TheSmarmyBum @ethereum That’s why I’m pro Doge
The @SkepticsGuide book is 👍
Lots of Tesla cars to deliver before year end! Your support in taking delivery is much appreciated. 

Thanks also to the Tesla team working hard during the holidays!
@scottwww @realrobcopeland Yeah, I didn’t have a house in the Bay Area for over a decade, despite spending half the week there
Whereas radar has trouble seeing small pedestrians, they’re obvious to Tesla vision
@nurodev Disney restricted us to US only
@JeffTutorials Yes, but if we find unexpected bugs, release might be delayed until 24th
Tesla holiday software release being tested with internal owners today. Broader rollout starts tomorrow evening.
@WholeMarsBlog We’re aiming for a significant improvement for owners outside the US around March, depending on regulatory approvals
@Gfilche It’s a great whistle!
@WholeMarsBlog This assumes completion of the 10b sales
@cleantechnica Pure vision, especially when using explicit photon count, is much better than radar+vision, as the latter has too much ambiguity – when radar &amp; vision disagree, it is not clear which one to believe
@teslatidbits @WholeMarsBlog @DanCrenshawTX A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
@daelmor @BillyM2k @DanCrenshawTX 🤣 People who don’t create products &amp; services don’t realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
@DanCrenshawTX Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected, but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?
@harald_murphy @SpaceX @Tesla @Jays200 A lot of improvement still coming just from software updates to satellites &amp; terminals
@Erdayastronaut I talked about Falcon 9 &amp; Heavy for over a decade!
@PPathole Still kinda hard to believe it is working
@PPathole @SpaceX Absolutely
100th SpaceX rocket landing was today
@BillyM2k Just keep going. It’s in there somewhere. https://t.co/jSLEIcXji1
@jack m something something
Has anyone seen web3? I can’t find it.
@BillyM2k With Starlink, you could stream video &amp; play online games
🤣🤣 True. Ask your airline for Starlink!
@JayinShanghai Sometime in 2022
@imoriginalankit Maybe I’m partly Chinese!
For those wondering, I will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year
@lexfridman Yeah
I’m not suggesting web3 is real – seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now – just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic!
@WorldAndScience Might very well be
Given the almost unimaginable nature of the present, what will the future be? https://t.co/b2Yw0AXGVA
@GailAlfarATX @peterdog15 @Tesla Tesla will hold a Giga Texas grand opening party with factory tours for the community in early 2022

Silco &amp; Jinx headline Coachella?
@NASASpaceflight Still aiming for booster 4 &amp; Ship 20 for first orbital test flight (this is pure coincidence!)
@F9Block5 Coming
@BLKMDL3 10.8 is close, so just jumping to that
@BLKMDL3 Probably
@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight Haha, this is not even its final form! Although, pretty close. 

Cape is hopefully this summer.
Tesla FSD 10.8 plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
@Space__Biscuit @NASASpaceflight 15 degrees
@NASASpaceflight Yup. Next booster will have 33 Raptor 2 engines, with 13 steering. 

Ship is being upgraded to 9 engines (3 sea-level gimbaling, 6 vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load.
Each Raptor 1 engine above produces 185 metric tons of force. Raptor 2 just started production &amp; will do 230+ tons or over half a million pounds of force.
@CathieDWood Interesting
@heydave7 @JohnnaCrider1 @SenWarren @buckporno The great state of Massachusetts deserves someone better
@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages Still much to be done, but it has that potential
@BBC_Future This is a big deal
@JeanMar49190094 @teslaownersSV It might be
@itsALLrisky Wow, this video took a lot of work!
@StianWalgermo @TeslaCharging @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @TeslaClubNorway Trondheim sounds cool

@TeslaOwnersEBay @PPathole @ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren It’s complicated, but hopefully out next quarter, along with Witcher. Lot of internal debate as to whether we should be putting effort towards generalized gaming emulation vs making individual games work well.
@PPathole @ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren Yeah!
@ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren I love Dilbert! Use it all the time to illustrate that we’re doing something wrong at Tesla/SpaceX if it could be a Dilbert cartoon irl. This happens more often than I’d like (sigh).
@alp_jp @Not_the_Bee @TheBabylonBee That is weird
Highly recommend all of @HardcoreHistory
@Newsweek Thanks!
@cleantechnica Congrats @jimfarley98
@Not_the_Bee @TheBabylonBee She’s tryin call to the manager rn 💯
@StonksReddit @americafirstmg @SenWarren Sneaky, but ineffective, like the rest of what she does 🤣🤣
@americafirstmg Explain yourself @SenWarren
@americafirstmg Interesting
@fttechnews Thank you!
@OwenSparks_ @Erdayastronaut Yup, that’s the plan!
@SenWarren Don’t spend it all at once … oh wait you did already
@SenWarren And if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year
@jimcramer @TIME X is pretty great
@jimcramer @TIME Thanks Jim!
@SenWarren Please don’t call the manager on me, Senator Karen 🙏

@Model3Owners That is not the production wiper
@tesletter Lasers can do anything
@Tesmanian_com There will be a few tweaks before production
@JeremyCom I do aspire to entertain the people!
@GailAlfarATX @SawyerMerritt @dogecoin Imbued gold/bronze color would be sick
@jackfarrington @SawyerMerritt Manufacturers have to ship cars with side mirrors by law, but owners are allowed to modify their cars.

The wiper is what troubles me most. No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal, but complex.
@TeslaDylan @SawyerMerritt Not at first, but there are many third party options for wrapping
@SawyerMerritt Cybertruck can have any color you want, so long as it’s nothing

@joshdcaplan It’s true
@teslafsdbeta Replacing faulty/missing neurons with circuits is the right way to think about it. Many problems can be solved just bridging signals between existing neurons.

Progress will accelerate when we have devices in humans (hard to have nuanced conversations with monkeys) next year.
@newsmax There are already minimum age requirements for the House, Senate &amp; Presidency. Reciprocally, there should be maximum age limits too.
@stocktalkweekly @neuralink I am definitely not saying that we can for sure do this, but I am increasingly confident that it is possible
@ICannot_Enough @kimpaquette Exactly
@UniverCurious That always blows my mind. Sad thing is that we haven’t been back to the moon in half a century.

@Tesmanian_com The magnitude of the Starship program is not widely appreciated. It is designed to extend life to Mars (and the moon), which requires ~1000 times more payload to orbit than all current Earth rockets combined.
@Tesmanian_com If a severe global recession were to dry up capital availability / liquidity while SpaceX was losing billions on Starlink &amp; Starship, then bankruptcy, while still unlikely, is not impossible.

GM &amp; Chrysler went BK last recession.

@Rubix161 @thesheetztweetz @GerberKawasaki It’s getting fixed
@TeslaGong @GerberKawasaki Suits will need to be made in high volume at an affordable cost &amp; be much easier to use
@GerberKawasaki We had to shift some Starlink satellite orbits to reduce probability of collision. Not great, but not terrible either.

Station &amp; Dragon have micrometeorite shields (ultra high velocity impact absorption), but EVA suits do not, hence higher risk for spacewalk.

@ajtourville We learned our lesson with $465M DoE loan received in 2010/2011 – onerous terms exceed value of money received. That’s why we paid it back so early, despite an early repayment penalty.
@timetravelart Maybe drive an upright Falcon 9 past the White House flying a giant Stars &amp; Stripes with a marching band playing “I can see clearly now”?
@PPathole @SpaceX That’s our initial interstage design that we scrapped
@existentialcoms Combined Tesla+SpaceX market cap is now over $1.2T, which means “$4.9B” is less than 0.4% of combined company value

@SawyerMerritt Such miracles are beyond us
@PPathole @Teslarati @13ericralph31 If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars, we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar.

Earth is ~4.5B years old, but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Earth has been and will be smashed super hard by meteors over time. Not a question of if, just when.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 In 1992, comet Shoemaker-Levy smashed a hole in Jupiter the size of Earth https://t.co/nruaHoSIAQ
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 This will be really important one day. 

Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth, but there were far more that “merely” destroyed a continent. 

Comets (not asteroids) are the real wild card, as we’re only able to track ~4600 out of  ~1 trillion.
About to launch asteroid defense test!
@Manic_Marge That is the great question
@westcoastbill Exactly
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly (sigh)
@cz_binance @CoinDesk @binance @egreechee Sounds good
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog It can simulate anywhere, but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta, then expand geographically to have betas in other countries. Canada is not a lot different from US, but different enough.
@WholeMarsBlog High-performance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate. We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping, then convert to C for fast execution.

New software is run against real-world video &amp; our world simulator to evaluate performance, then QA.
@cz_binance @CoinDesk @binance @egreechee I don’t use Binance (tried at one point, but signup was too many hoops to jump through), so no inconvenience to me personally. Just raising this issue on behalf of other Doge holders.
@WholeMarsBlog Our NNs didn’t have any temporal &amp; spatial memory or surround video auto-labeling back then – everything was knitted together in C++ from single frames with manual labeling.

Still much to improve.
@binance @CoinDesk @egreechee @cz_binance Doge holders using Binance should be protected from errors that are not their fault
@mishaboar Wisdom
@CoinDesk @binance @egreechee Hey @cz_binance, what’s going on with your Doge customers? Sounds shady.
@WholeMarsBlog I was able to do several zero takeover drives around Austin last night using random map pin drops (no Tesla has ever done these routes)

@billhuang688 @teslaownersSV @boringcompany We do need to have the Fallout-themed party! Aiming to do that once international travel restrictions are lifted.
@mickakers @teslaownersSV @boringcompany Meant to say county (sigh). Airport will be part of it, but required additional federal approvals.
@cleantechnica Transforming America!
@teslaownersSV @boringcompany It’s either traffic forever or tunnels. Try our first operational tunnel in Vegas at the convention center! The city just approved a full tunnel network, connecting major hotels, convention center &amp; airport.
@Rainmaker1973 Interesting eyes too
@ErcXspace @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Long-term, ship would land on tower arms, like booster
@ErcXspace @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Unlikely for early ships to splashdown intact. Getting to orbit at all on first try would be a major win.

@flcnhvy Accept worst case outcome &amp; assign it a probability, which is usually very low. Now think of good things in life &amp; assign them probabilities – many are certain!

Bringing anxiety/fear to the conscious mind saps it of limbic emotional strength.

Cheery fatalism is very effective.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Limiting factor for first launch is regulatory approval. Thereafter, fundamental issue is solving engine production.

Prototypes are easy, production is hard.
@John_Gardi True, although it will look clean with close out panels installed. 

Raptor 2 has significant improvements in every way, but a complete design overhaul is necessary for the engine that can actually make life multiplanetary. It won’t be called Raptor.

@BillyM2k Normal money is actually a bunch of ancient mainframes running cobol in batch mode, where govt can edit money database whenever they want
@Paul49787221 @mooroobee @itsALLrisky @SenSanders Exactly
@PPathole @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @itsALLrisky @SenSanders Yes, that is the other major source of dilution. All employees receive stock after a year at Tesla and we now have over 100,000 employees worldwide.
@MyAlteredEgo @kedarus @CollegeChef1 @JoeyTParker @SenSanders That loophole does seem questionable
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @itsALLrisky @SenSanders I had majority control for the first 5 years or so of Tesla, but car companies need lots of capital, so now I’m around 20% or so, despite putting in as much as I could along the way
@itsALLrisky @SenSanders Agreed, taxes are best applied to (especially extravagant) consumption, whereas capital allocation taxes reduce goods &amp; services output, so actually bad for the people.

Probable capital allocation skill of heirs is lower than original creator, so I am in favor of an estate tax.
@dogeofficialceo @daelmor @SenSanders Regretamine, it’s like a 100% tax on all your regrets!

@SenSanders Ok, how much do you think is fair? Does 53% seem reasonable?
@Blockworks_ Inflation is the most regressive tax of all, yet is advocated by those who claim to be progressive

@PPathole @SenSanders Bernie is a taker, not a maker
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
@SenSanders Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word …
@fermatslibrary Soon, that list will grow much longer as humanity reaches new heights!
@SenSanders I keep forgetting that you’re still alive
@heydave7 @WholeMarsBlog A careful observer would note that my (low basis) share sale rate significantly exceeds my 10b (high basis) option exercise rate, thus closer to tax maximization than minimization.
@JonErlichman How about predictions for 2030?
@ICannot_Enough Please don’t read too much into this. As mentioned publicly, Tesla is constrained by chip supply short-term &amp; cell supply long-term. 

Not possible to produce additional vehicles in volume until both constraints are addressed.
@GailAlfarATX @JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog @TeslaOwnersEBay @RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @Boxabl I’ve actually been living in a ~$50k house in south Texas for past 2 years, not Boxabl (cool product tho).

@SpaceIntellige3 @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @nkknspace @HomemDoEspacoBr @InfographicTony @cnunezimages @spacex360 Inter-satellite laser communications means Starlink can carry data at speed of light in vacuum all around Earth before touching ground.

Over time, some amount of communication can simply be from one user terminal to another without touching the Internet.
@Erdayastronaut It is a very impressive history
@teslaownersSV @SamTwits Once the board was presented with the evidence of Eberhard’s deception/fraud &amp; the dire state of the company, all board members, including those he appointed, voted unanimously to fire him in August 2007.
@teslaownersSV @SamTwits He came damn close to killing Tesla through a combination of bad management decisions, driving out talented people, bad engineering, major blunders in supply chain &amp; an elaborate deception about the true cost &amp; schedule of the Tesla Roadster.
@SamTwits Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false. I wish I had never met him.

Eberhard is by far the worst person I’ve ever worked with in my entire career. Given how many people I’ve worked with over the years, that’s really saying something …
@NASASpaceflight Good static fire with all six engines!
@teslaownersSV @24_7TeslaNews @SpaceX No guarantees, but maybe next month. Requires quite a lot of incremental testing &amp; code tweaks for different road system in Canada.
@24_7TeslaNews @teslaownersSV @SpaceX Hoping to start releasing to 98 scores with V10.5 in about 10 days
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Ancient times
@SamTwits I hope they’re able to achieve high production &amp; breakeven cash flow. That is the true test. 

There have been hundreds of automotive startups, both electric &amp; combustion, but Tesla is only American carmaker to reach high volume production &amp; positive cash flow in past 100 years.
@PPathole @SpaceX Pattern on the Starlink router is orbital transfer ellipse from Earth to Mars
@SawyerMerritt New UAW slogan: “Fighting for their right to steal money from workers!”
@Rainmaker1973 Interestingly, however, average power density of the sun is comparable to a compost heap (humans are more power dense than the sun) – it is just very, very big
@SawyerMerritt There are many other good causes, but this is my main reason for accumulating capital. 

The resources I consume personally are very low.
@Tenjin37151 @Space_Station @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew @NASA @esa @JAXA_en @astro_kimbrough @Astro_Megan @Thom_astro @Aki_Hoshide As described in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (great book), a linear accelerator would be great for the moon. 

Earth’s gravity is too high &amp; atmosphere too dense for accelerators to be a good solution vs reusable boosters imo.
@Space_Station @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew @NASA @esa @JAXA_en @astro_kimbrough @Astro_Megan @Thom_astro @Aki_Hoshide Still blows my mind that this is real

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @Arianespace @ArianeGroup @roscosmos @northropgrumman @ulalaunch @torybruno @isro @RocketLab The Starship fleet is designed to achieve over 1000 times more payload to orbit than all other rockets on Earth combined. 

Almost no one understands this.
@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @Arianespace @ArianeGroup @roscosmos @northropgrumman @ulalaunch @torybruno @isro @RocketLab True
@thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @Arianespace @ArianeGroup @roscosmos @northropgrumman @ulalaunch @torybruno @isro @RocketLab Actually, 41 tons for SpaceX in Q3 &amp; aiming for 80 tons in Q4. That said, China launch mass to orbit is extremely impressive.
@shawncarelli @RonWyden Coming soon

@WholeMarsBlog Doing the opposite of whatever that insufferable numbskull says would be a great way to invest!
@24_7TeslaNews @WholeMarsBlog We are rolling 10.4 out slowly, as there are many subtle hardware differences in the owner fleet. If it continues to look good over the next few days, we may start rolling out to 98 safety scores.
@WholeMarsBlog Will consider

Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.
I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes
@lifeplusreward @BillyM2k Wrath of the Khans @HardcoreHistory
Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.

Do you support this?
@BillyM2k I say this frequently
@teslaownersSV Haha true! The top alternate name, if we couldn’t acquire the Tesla Motors trademark, was Faraday, which a competitor ended up using.
@WholeMarsBlog Some late-breaking issues with 10.4. We’re deploying a patch to internal beta vehicles around 3am tomorrow. 

If that goes well, we may be able to release 10.4 to external beta vehicles on Sunday. Many good improvements.
@DrEliDavid Seems that way. Publishing their transaction ledger would clarify matters.
@Jon4Lakers @Tesla We will post finer-grained details of software improvements going forward
@koolio @Jon4Lakers @Tesla Exactly. Improved memory will cause predictions to converge &amp; reduce jitter.
@Teslarati @Writer_01001101 In the future, any Tesla you use will automatically sync to your preferences
@BLKMDL3 @Jon4Lakers @Tesla Probable
@Jon4Lakers @Tesla Neural net upgrades coming that improve persistence across time &amp; space (better object permanence)
@teslaownersSV Cool :)

@Tesmanian_com What they are doing is just not right
@Tesmanian_com sigh
@teslaownersSV You’re welcome!

If any of this is based on Hertz, I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.

Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.

Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.
@shiraeis @BillyM2k It’s simulations all the way down, until eventually it’s just 1 bit

Sunlight is a wonderful thing.
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla By definition, since I own ~20% of Tesla, ~80% of stock gains necessarily went to investors &amp; employees!

@DrEliDavid If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.
@ErcXspace @NASASpaceflight Pretty close
@hsumacher @Tesla Indeed. The factory was empty at the time, stripped of all equipment that wasn’t worth even its scrap value. But we salvaged what was left &amp; fixed up the old machines so some could work again.

@ecommerceshares The cemetery of automotive startups over the past century is very large &amp; will get larger. Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American car companies that haven’t gone bankrupt.
@TeslaHype @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Indeed, US taxpayers actually profited from the Tesla loan
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge GM &amp; Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid), but Tesla was not.

Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in 2009, from which they did very well.

Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in 2010, by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early.
@wapodavenport My plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness
@wapodavenport US Federal Debt/GDP was 56% in 2000, now it is 126% &amp; climbing fast
@wapodavenport US national debt is ~$28,900 billion or ~$229k per taxpayer.

Even taxing all “billionaires” at 100% would only make a small dent in that number, so obviously the rest must come from the general public. This is basic math.

Spending is the real problem.

https://t.co/1EwWyqdVsT
@tesla_raj You can also talk through the car speaker. Great for practical jokes :)
@jgrano305 @WholeMarsBlog Tentative plan is 98 &amp; above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week.

If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4.

10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic &amp; stopping for gates.
@WholeMarsBlog FSD/AI team is doing great work. Will get superhuman good in upcoming releases. 

Note, we will slow down upload rate of releases going forward. First from QA fleet to employee cars for a day, then slowly releasing at ~1000 cars/hr to external beta on Friday aft.
@JayinShanghai That math is incorrect, but still a lot of devices per second! 

I guess if Tesla can reach 20M cars/year, that would be one every ~1.5 seconds!
@wapodavenport According to their own estimates, this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill. 

Where will the other 90% come from? 

The answer is you.
@teslaownersSV Wow, 13 years ago
@TheBabylonBee I feel like this has happened at Tesla a few times
@MorningBrew I kinda like avocado toast &amp; pro level coffee tbh :) Starbase cuisine does an amazing job with those.
@QuantaMagazine Another way of saying we’re in a simulation
@PPathole @Tesla Reducing traffic fatalities by 90% seems likely, perhaps ultimately by over 99%
@LudaLisl @sat1 @Hertz Also, Tesla will soon be a German car manufacturer.
@LudaLisl @sat1 @Hertz German car manufacturers will rebound strongly. They possess great talent, which will not sit idle.
@CathieDWood But the Bee nails it again 🤣🤣 https://t.co/eTDmxVrYxZ
@podcastnotes Who is best at capital allocation – government or entrepreneurs – is indeed what it comes down to. 

The tricksters will conflate capital allocation with consumption.
@JackBox Thanks 😎
@cnunezimages @SpaceX @SpaceIntellige3 Truth is stranger than fiction
@GerberKawasaki To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers.
@CathieDWood I don’t know about long-term, but short-term we are seeing strong inflationary pressure
@RichardMcCrackn @RonWyden @JeffBezos Exactly. Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you.
@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I’d like to express appreciation to Tesla Autopilot engineering &amp; QA for working round the clock all weekend to resolve the problem
@Teslarati @KlenderJoey Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. 

Our internal QA fleet didn’t see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward.
@GerberKawasaki Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem
Wild $T1mes!
@coach23life @SawyerMerritt Indeed, this is intended to be useful advice, based on my extremely painful experience, not an attack in any way
@SawyerMerritt Prototypes are trivial compared to scaling production &amp; supply chain. If those are solved, achieving positive gross margin is the next nightmare. 

Starting a second new vehicle line before first is working will divide resources &amp; amplify probability of failure.
@kimpaquette @Hertz @TomBrady That feature is coming

@engineers_feed Wasn’t easy
@ProTheDoge Lots of people I talked to on the production lines at Tesla or building rockets at SpaceX own Doge. They aren’t financial experts or Silicon Valley technologists. That’s why I decided to support Doge – it felt like the people’s crypto.
Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. 

Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta.
@Filasophical @ShibaInuHodler Out of curiosity, I acquired some ascii hash strings called “Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Doge”. That’s it. 

As I’ve said before, don’t bet the farm on crypto! True value is building products &amp; providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form.
@ShibaInuHodler None
@itsALLrisky @TeslaGong @mishaboar @DogecoinFdn Possibly. Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth &amp; high latency. If both continue to improve substantially, we will reach a point when no second layer is needed.
@jchybow @WholeMarsBlog We’re working on this issue right now
@TeslaGong @mishaboar @DogecoinFdn Not recently. What matters imo is lowering fees, decreasing block time &amp; increasing block size. A single layer network with exchanges as de facto layer 2 seems like the simplest solution for a medium of exchange.
@Kristennetten As requested
@Erdayastronaut Got to 321 bar before RUD, but cause may be due to oxygen inlet pressure too low, rather than engine issues
@cleantechnica We live in a gerontocracy
@BillyM2k Plus crypto scams haha
@mishaboar @DogecoinFdn Neither Jared, nor me, nor anyone I know has anything to do with this foundation
Your support makes a big difference! Please let the FAA know your opinion.

@shortword Yeah, headlights are precision LED, so they can be bright without blinding oncoming traffic, pedestrians &amp; cyclists
@truth_tesla It will hopefully achieve sustained cycle time of 45 seconds. At 75% uptime over an average week, that’s ~10k/week if run 24/7.
@teslaownersSV Sunday/Monday
A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.
@LifeofMikej @TeslaOwnersBC @DriveTeslaca @Tesla @Teslarati There are many small joys as you explore the car &amp; more to come via software updates
@Model3Owners So crazy to have come this far!
@Tesmanian_com Exactly
If you’d like to join Tesla AI, but can’t easily move to Palo Alto or Austin, that is acceptable for extremely excellent candidates where inefficiency of distance is overcome by talent

@PeterDiamandis I’m so dying to do a supersonic, electric VOTL jet, but adding more work will make my 🧠 🧨
Starlink is designed for low to medium population density, which means we can hit max users in some areas fast. 

Please sign up early to ensure a spot. As more satellites roll out, SpaceX will be able to serve more. 

https://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i
@jc_comrade Should be nationwide rollout by end of month. Note, still limited by peak number of users in same area. 

This will improve as more satellites are launched.
@GerberKawasaki Haha true
@johnkrausphotos Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem!
@lexfridman Sure
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 It’s a big deal that Dragon is reusable, with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight! This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft.

It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made.
@probablyup Long list of mostly little items, but driving experience is significantly better. We will put notable changes in the release notes.
@jgrano305 Everyone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe 1100 to 1200 by Friday night.
@TeslaClubWI Note, quality of experience can vary dramatically, as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than others, but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions.
@SahilBloom Try explaining it to a 17-month-old – that’s hard!
FSD Beta 10.2 rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect 100/100 safety scores. 

Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes. 

If that looks good, beta will gradually begin rolling out to 99 scores &amp; below.
@cleantechnica Tesla always pays its debts
@Teslarati @KlenderJoey This was *extremely* difficult. Huge props to Tesla engineering, supply chain, production &amp; key suppliers.
@TheStonkJunky Awesome, effortless ordering is our goal :)
@PPathole Tough choice – so many great movies –but Spaceballs for me
@vm_one1 Lookin good …
Walk this way … no, *this* way …

@SawyerMerritt I wish I had had the opportunity to talk to him
@YoshikiOfficial @Benioff @netflix @TIME @hiromichimizuno @inspiration4x Same
@28delayslater Good point, will discuss with team. Floki pic tomorrow.
@Real_Futurist @flcnhvy @inspiration4x New Dune is good
@flcnhvy @inspiration4x I really wanted to like it
Amazing show about @Inspiration4x mission! https://t.co/0nQua4jGiz
@alex_avoigt Manufacturing will be Tesla’s long-term competitive strength
This is real btw
And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!
@RocketLab360 Will be Falcon 9 size sooner or later
@CStyles45 @Tesla Pushed a week to align with 10.2
With https://t.co/45B5nUBaxb &amp; Powerwall battery you are your own utility. 

24/7 clean, sustainable electricity.
@astro_kimbrough @SpaceX Hello @Space_Station, great pic! (That’s me waving)
@Tesmanian_com That is the goal
@LabPadre Proof was good!
@pcgamer AMD has been great to work with!
@Gfilche @freshjiva No guarantees, but I think it will. This is  a big part of what I meant by Tesla’s long-term competitive advantage being manufacturing technology.
@thesheetztweetz SpaceX has sued to be *allowed* to compete, BO is suing to stop competition
@SPACEdotcom Maxwell was incredible
@mortenlund89 Really?
@BillyM2k Hamster has mad skillz!!
@slashdot This is a serious concern.
@SciGuySpace @Neopork85 @NASASpaceflight We aim to do the most for the least $
Apologies, 10.2 release will be a week from Friday
@BLKMDL3 First few days probably 100/100, then 99, 98, etc.
Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version 10.2 midnight Friday, then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day, prioritized by safety rating.
@Erdayastronaut @LabPadre If tiles are not super thin, you get hot plasma “waterfalling” off edges of tiles, creating hotspots. 

That said, I’m not entirely convinced that this couldn’t be done with several overlapping scales of metal sheet with an insulator between scale armor &amp; primary structure.
@LabPadre Headed tank vent knocked off a few tiles
@scott_peak Cybertruck option package
@scott_peak Of course
@Rainmaker1973 Where is Hitchcock when you need him?
@Rainmaker1973 Illustrates why Tesla sales will soon exceed mass of universe
@alex_avoigt In an electric future, batteries are as essential to transport as oil is today
@wadeanderson Noted. You should be able to press mic button &amp; say “bug report …”
@kimpaquette A helpful case to consider, as the roads intersect at unusual angles
@pcgamer True
@bluemoondance74 @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX “Comes in discreet packaging”
@cnunezimages @SpaceX Well ya see we need to reach around the rocket to uhh …
@Sushihunter2 @pitt_geoff @rajz06 @Tesla @Everman We use no cobalt at all in most of our cars &amp; tiny amounts in others (going to zero soon), whereas phones &amp; laptops primarily use cobalt
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut And booster used to be 70m, but this required an awkward half barrel width of steel, so now it’s 69m
@Nick_Stevens_Gr Haha so true of rocket engine development
@WholeMarsBlog Very much a beta calculation. It will evolve over time to more accurately predict crash probability.
FSD Beta request button goes live tonight, but FSD 10.1 needs another 24 hours of testing, so out tomorrow night
@thesheetztweetz Chris was an early employee of SpaceX, and made a significant contribution, but was not a cofounder
@SpaceXMR Maybe reality is a Rick &amp; Morty episode
@RenataKonkoly @FelixSchlang @KathyLueders @SpaceX @BoeingSpace I didn’t think so at the time
@thesheetztweetz So pointy! https://t.co/XMRQKpmy0t
@BillyM2k Super important for Doge fees to drop to make things like buying movie tix viable
@EvaFoxU @ChesterNoBS @truth_tesla Giga Berlin will help a lot
@SueOrigin @SciGuySpace That would break the NASA budget!
@simongerman600 @waitbutwhy @SeppalaVilleEN Birth rate collapse is the biggest threat to human civilization
@wapodavenport We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.
@EvaFoxU @ChesterNoBS @truth_tesla Logistics is underrated
@EvaFoxU @ChesterNoBS @truth_tesla Exactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts of China, then cars for nearby parts of China. 

Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1.
@rookisaacman @ArceneauxHayley @DrSianProctor @ChrisSembroski @inspiration4x @StJude Great view of Earth!
@HistoryInPics Tesla is the king of car farts!
@ro_ma_vive @cybrtrkguy Hopefully worldwide long-term, but insurance is a regulatory labyrinth/escape room!
@cybrtrkguy The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow &amp; complex, varying considerably by state. 

Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month.

Probably next year before we get approval in New York.
@ElectricRaph @28delayslater @KounisTou Good point, we could enable visualization before control. Will enable that option hopefully next month.
@TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaGong @inspiration4x Definitely upgraded toilets :) We had some challenges with it this flight.
@carsonight Not super surprising, given that internal combustion engine cars literally have “combustion” in the name
@TeslaGong @inspiration4x Yeah, a little oven for heating food &amp; Starlink wifi
Just met with the @Inspiration4x crew in Florida to congratulate them in person. Such great people!
@ray4tesla Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location
@AustinTeslaClub To be precise, completely &amp; immediately reusable orbital rockets are the fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary
@teslaownersSV @Tesla Which games did they like most?
@tegmark Nice work!
@teslaownersSV @TeslaGong @WholeMarsBlog Good
@TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @WholeMarsBlog No, has to be turned on by car owner
@teslaownersSV @WholeMarsBlog Tesla insurance calculator will show status in real-time &amp; tell you what actions are needed to be rated “good driver”
@BLKMDL3 @WholeMarsBlog 7 days after approval to log driving style
@starbasergv Not a tiny engine
@WholeMarsBlog Remarkable how few people realize this capability exists. Many think it is 5 years away! With public beta rollout in coming weeks, awareness should improve dramatically.
@FiveTweetTSLA @tesla_lion @archillect Seems that way
@archillect Looks fine. Take 2 aspirin, call me in the morning.
@TheMarsSociety @NASA Some amount of cooperation would be good
@RenataKonkoly @rhensing @johnkrausphotos Absolutely
@rhensing He’s still sleeping
@stats_feed Needs a little warming up
@AustinTeslaClub @Tesla @TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaOwnersUAE @EvaFoxU @leastImAlive @teslaownersSV @gailalfa1 @live_munro @OwenSparks_ I wish there were more
@AustinTeslaClub @Tesla @TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaOwnersUAE @EvaFoxU @leastImAlive @teslaownersSV @gailalfa1 @live_munro @OwenSparks_ So few products that you truly love 💕
@inspiration4x @ArceneauxHayley @rookisaacman @DrSianProctor @ChrisSembroski @StJude Count me in for $50M
Congratulations @Inspiration4x!!!
@OwenSparks_ @ChrisSembroski One of my favorite movies
@TeslaGong @BryceSpaceTech Yes

No, but it will get refilled &amp; maybe cargo transfer
@enn_nafnlaus @BryceSpaceTech Making life multiplanetary is an extremely hard, but not impossible, problem
@BryceSpaceTech Still basically nothing compared to the orbital mass flux needed for a base on moon or Mars
@kittynouveau Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build, but won’t work with FSD. Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though.
@NevanRead @A11electric It will be there
@slashdot Sigh
@SamTwits @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4. 

Also, easy to make &amp; store CH4+O2 from CO2+H2O, which are abundant on Mars.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Fully reusable rockets want high T/W to minimize $/ton to orbit, because propellant cost actually matters
@WholeMarsBlog Automatically drive to most obvious location unless occupant says otherwise
@WatchersTank @SpaceX With that, Ship is basically begging for an extra 3 engines
@Aristot21520213 @ray4tesla Exactly
@ignaciobelieres @oza_shiv @lrocket “Ignition!”
@oza_shiv @lrocket Throw in some hydrogen &amp; lithium for a real party
@lrocket What propellant?
Moving at ~23 times speed of sound, circling Earth every ~90 minutes
@hiromichimizuno Ironically, yes at this time. FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isn’t necessary, but it is. Also, any beta user who isn’t super careful will get booted. 

2000 beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents. Needs to stay that way.
@Erdayastronaut @inspiration4x Yeah. We’d use our Ka parabolics or laser links for Dragon, Starship or other spacecraft as soon as they got above cloud level.
@TeslaNY Jay is right
Please add your voice to the public comments. Support is greatly appreciated! 

Humanity’s future on the moon, Mars &amp; beyond depends upon it.

Thanks, 
Elon
@TrungTPhan The lesson from “tortoise &amp; hare” is not that tortoises are faster, but rather that hares should not be complacent
@cleantechnica September will be interesting
@StianWalgermo Technology probably ready in a few months, thereafter limited by regulatory approval
@IvanEscobosa Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted.
@OvershieId Next month
Good feedback from FSD Beta 10 users! 10.0.1 point release rolling out now. 

10.1 rolls out a week from Friday with beta request button.
@EliBurton_ @SpaceX @zubinanary @MyTeslaAdventur Truth is stranger than fiction
@XHNews Congratulations on a successful mission!
@pcgamer RIP, Sir Sinclair. I loved that computer.
Just spoke with @inspiration4x crew. All is well.
@lexfridman @SpaceX Missions like Inspiration4 help advance spaceflight to enable ultimately anyone to go to orbit &amp; beyond
@jack That’s my safe word too
@teslaownersSV Maneuverability is important for safety
@richardbranson @SpaceX @inspiration4x Thanks Richard!
@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thank you
@inspiration4x @ChrisSembroski @rookisaacman @DrSianProctor @ArceneauxHayley It was an honor to wish you Godspeed before you left for orbit!
Watch Countdown on Netflix about Inspiration4 mission launching today
@thesheetztweetz @NASAKennedy @SpaceX It is hard to overstate criticality of reusable rockets. No less important than reusable aircraft, cars or bicycles.

Essential for humanity to become a multiplanet species &amp; backup the biosphere.
@RationalEtienne It has indeed become hard to find which platform has which show
@Gfilche I’m not saying there are UFOs … but there are UFOs
@Gfilche Also, we need to figure out how to render voxel height of unknown objects in a way that isn’t horrendous

@WholeMarsBlog @POTUS (Ahem)
@BLKMDL3 @WholeMarsBlog Literally!
@Matt_Lowne Forward flaps will change a lot in upcoming versions of Starship – smaller &amp; more leeward
@WholeMarsBlog This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.  https://t.co/FUUXARHlby
@OliOnOrbit Falcon 9 is technically a heavy lift rocket. If flown as an expendable, payload to orbit is similar to Delta IV Heavy (~25 tons to LEO).

And Starship is ~10 times bigger.
@TeslaPodcast Nice drive
@ICannot_Enough @garyblack00 With 10.1, it will creep forward with more confidence &amp; quickly reverse back a little (just as a person would) if it sees danger
@FrenchieEAP Think of Beta 10 as enabling a significantly higher local maximum than Beta 9
@WholeMarsBlog To be fair, investors are giving us significant credit for achieving self-driving, given that Tesla’s valuation/production is very high compared to other automakers
@BLKMDL3 @teslaownersSV Three weeks

@TimSweeneyEpic Didn’t you sorta win? https://t.co/eNu5Oh9Ogx
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Highway stack is still production version, as it is more polished than FSD for now. Single stack for all should release in 10.1.
@SpaceX These are V1.5 Starlinks with laser inter-satellite links, which are needed for high latitudes &amp; mid ocean coverage
@JeffTutorials An early season episode of the Tesla soap opera!
@nuerburgring @Tesla Great work by Tesla team, with special thanks to Tesla Automation in Prüm, who were critical to many high-performance parts of Plaid!
@4sanjaymathew @thesheetztweetz @esa @AschbacherJosef @SpaceX @SpireGlobal Exactly. Getting paid by the government to launch payloads at much lower prices than competitors is not “government support”.
@TGMetsFan98 @NASASpaceflight Satellites with “lasers” in “space” [strokes white cat]
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 @SpacePadreIsle Booster static fire on orbital launch mount hopefully next week
@BLKMDL3 Track software update probably a few weeks away (I know, I know haha). Also waypoints &amp; other things.
@AaronS5_ Tesla doesn’t have the bandwidth to do it, but there are some good third party mod shops
Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop)
Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified, directly from factory. https://t.co/AaiFtfW5Ht
@burkov Maybe not, but it’s 99% dot products
@WholeMarsBlog The build I’m driving right now is almost there. FSD 10 will blow your mind.
@WholeMarsBlog Expansion will be gradual, based on ensuring maximum safety
@28delayslater @slashdot Am I a yoke to you? 😢
@28delayslater @slashdot Yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.

@flcnhvy @JeffTutorials That’s one of my tests!
@WholeMarsBlog I’m not always late haha
@anthonyisonline Large incumbent carmakers sell their cars at low to zero true margin. Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet, of which 70% to 80% are past warranty. 

Like razors &amp; blades.

New car companies lack this advantage. Also lack sales &amp; service infrastructure.
@anthonyisonline Production is hard. Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard.
@SP_LimitReviews @Tesla @CodingMark @Manic_Marge @teslainventory @WholeMarsBlog Lot of good work happening on Tesla sound codec &amp; audio software in general. Aiming for maximum music dopamine in your brain!
@TrungTPhan A lot has happened in the past 8 years
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe This is obv debatable, but I’d call anything with ~300 miles / ~500 km of true usable travel distance “long range”, beyond that “very long range”
@WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. 

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.

Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft.
@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes. 

Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.

Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.

Pretty basic.
Time is the ultimate currency
@long_elon @LimitingThe Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more
@LimitingThe Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use.
@teslaownersSV And Beta 10 is a step change improvement from what you have!
@leastImAlive @archillect 🤣🤣 “I’m fkn tryin”
@TeslaAIBot @EffinZach Ur welcome, pls be nice to the humans
@archillect Smoked ham
@dogecoin_devs Good progress. Applying information theory to currency (which is just information), lower fees reduce noise &amp; faster &amp; more consistent sync time improve latency &amp; jitter.
@EffinZach The robots are coming anyway, as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show. 

I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe, but I can try my best to do so at Tesla.
@thesheetztweetz @SquawkStreet In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.
@DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber &amp; shorter path. 

Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!
@tobyliiiiiiiiii Not sure, but maybe a few months. In general for any region, we need to make software work well, test it extensively &amp; then get regulatory approval. If we could go faster while being safe, we would!
@VitalikButerin What is love?
FSD Beta 10 rolls out midnight Friday next week
@Kristennetten @StianWalgermo @Tesla @ARKInvest @WholeMarsBlog @alex_avoigt @Teslarati @TeslaPodcast @mortenlund89 I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit. It’s gonna be great! 

But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production. Production is super hard work, which is why I have great respect for those who do it.
@thesheetztweetz They can shake their fist at the sky
@StianWalgermo @Tesla @ARKInvest @WholeMarsBlog @alex_avoigt @Teslarati @TeslaPodcast @mortenlund89 @Kristennetten Norway FTW 🇳🇴 💕

@ashleevance Maybe zap him on the head with our space lasers …
@DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Technically, data packets do not need to touch regular Internet – data can flow from user terminal to satellite/s to user terminal
@DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Our satellites launching in next few months have inter-satellite laser links, so no local downlink needed. Probably active in 4 to 6 months.
@thesheetztweetz Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job https://t.co/XifRICQ62k

@WholeMarsBlog Beta 10 coming soon!
@RobertIger Am watching Star Wars: Bad Batch with lil baby X. Waiting for Season 2!
@NASASpaceflight Hopefully first try with booster 5
@Astro_Elliott @PPathole Tank treads on the arms
@PPathole Booster has 2 pins for lifting &amp; catching, although maybe it’s better to modify grid fins to take more load. 

Something will need to flip out from leeward side of top of ship to do same there. Maybe it’s part of fwd flaps, but prob not.

Diff solutions for diff load paths.
SpaceX will try to catch largest ever flying object with robot chopsticks.

Success is not guaranteed, but excitement is!

@SawyerMerritt Don’t want to be unreasonable, but maybe they should be required to deliver at least one vehicle per billion dollars of valuation *before* the IPO?
@teslaownersSV Sure
@WholeMarsBlog Good point
@stevenmarkryan @GerberKawasaki Pretty much
@jgrano305 Good point. We do have torque reduction if an obstacle is detected, but active braking would be better. Prime directive is: do not crash.
@IzanRamos2002 @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @MarcusHouse @FelixSchlang Impressive render. Warts &amp; all! New version of Raptor is much cleaner.
@wapodavenport Turns out Besos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …
@SawyerMerritt Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel &amp; iron.

I’d personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100%, whereas nickel prefers ~90%.
@heydave7 2 weeks
@vincent13031925 This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor
@WholeMarsBlog Beta 10 will be next-level
@wlopwangling … is a hydrogen sonata
@TeslaTruckClub Nice
@F9Block5 We should be there with Beta 10, which goes out a week from Friday (no point release this week). 

It will have a completely retrained NN, so will need another few weeks after that for tuning &amp; bug fixes. Best guess is public beta button in ~4 weeks.
@WholeMarsBlog @kimpaquette In general, we overfit to SF Bay Area
@Model3Owners Nothing’s perfect haha
@28delayslater It’s amazing by most standards, but we are aiming for 1000% safer than the average human driver
@RGVaerialphotos @SpaceX Can’t wait for new high bay!

@vincent13031925 Will make a big difference
@Erdayastronaut @Caspar_Stanley No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starship’s low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. 

Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Don’t want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma.
@zone_astronomy Low center of mass. Bit like our ship &amp; booster on reentry.
@GerberKawasaki Same
@Erdayastronaut @Caspar_Stanley Probably slightly further forward, smaller, more inward. No funny looking static aero at top, as static aero no longer directly in flow.
@Erdayastronaut Btw, there’s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards. 

New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward &amp; further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart.
@AmyAcker @lisajoynolan @Reminiscence Product ideas!
@CodingMark @Tesla True
@Delta_IV_Heavy You can make anything fly haha
@MKBHD Impressive
@cleantechnica Robyn is great
@OstynHyss @nickwhoward Beta 10 or maybe 10.1. Going to pure vision set us back initially. Vision plus (coarse) radar had us trapped in a local maximum, like a level cap.

Pure vision requires fairly advanced real-world AI, but that’s how our whole road system is designed to work: NN’s with vision.
@shawncarelli @nickwhoward 9.3, probably 9.4 &amp; then maybe 10. Significant architecture changes in 10.

Mars is a lot harder, because Earth &amp; Mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.

@999BPM @tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog No amount of money can defy physics
@jack Twitter DM laughing emoji is nightmare
@C3LT_Games @ErcXspace Yes on both counts. That would be a great outcome for civilization.
@l3nnybob @Grimezsz Preferably, on Mars
@Grimezsz I will welcome death when it comes
@ErcXspace And ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for moon &amp; Mars until there is local infrastructure.
@ErcXspace Pretty close. Booster &amp; arms will move faster. QD arm will steady booster for ship mate.
Priority for residents of Brandenburg &amp; Berlin, but also open to general public
Giga Berlin-Brandenburg county fair &amp; factory tour on 9 October!
@JeffTutorials The staying power of a bad idea is astonishing
@wapodavenport Note, should be “refill”, not “refuel”. ~78% of propellant is liquid oxygen, only ~22% is fuel.
@CathieDWood Tesla makes cars for export in first half of quarter &amp; for local market in second half. 

As publicly disclosed, we are operating under extreme supply chain limitations regarding certain “standard” automotive chips. 

Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp; Bosch.
@considercosmos @SpaceX Booster &amp; Ship will return to orbital launch pad on Monday (winds allowing). Just finishing off some small plumbing &amp; wiring, which is easier in high bay.
@RationalEtienne @Erdayastronaut I hope I do
@spacex360 If lobbying &amp; lawyers could get u to orbit, Bezos would be on Pluto rn
@spacex360 Exactly
@wapodavenport Somehow, this wasn’t convincing … https://t.co/qAn8Y6i5Ys
@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I’d recommend they get their first plant working. It’s insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge It’s gonna be awesome
@wapodavenport However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.
@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights.
@lrocket @thesheetztweetz Yeah
@cleantechnica Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10,000 unique parts in a car
@thesheetztweetz SpaceX could do it if need be
@thesheetztweetz Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen
@ID_AA_Carmack @shivon Always loved those Empire State photos with people eating lunch out on the beam
@brian_armstrong @MarkWarner Agreed, this is not the time to pick technology winners or losers in cryptocurrency technology. There is no crisis that compels hasty legislation.
@teslaownersSV Long time
An honor to work with such a great team
@DanaEn803 @Dr_ThomasZ @thesheetztweetz @SpaceX Sure
@Kristennetten @SpaceX It will be exciting to see what new cultures humanity creates on other heavenly bodies!
@Dr_ThomasZ @thesheetztweetz @SpaceX Due to its size &amp; ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions
Minus the lifts https://t.co/kokDQQymhN
@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built – it’s an insanely hard problem. 

Moreover, it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.

Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large.
@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:

Booster
- Grid fins for aero control
- Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Protecting engines from entry loads

Ship
- Body flaps for aero control
- Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Heat shield
@Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably
@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.
@thesheetztweetz It is ~98% done, but the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining
@thesheetztweetz 4 significant items:

- Final heat shield tiles for ship
- Thermal protection of booster engines
- Ground propellant storage tanks
- QD arm for ship

2 weeks.
@thesheetztweetz Dream come true
@jrosinski97 @SpaceX Absolutely
Starship Fully Stacked https://t.co/Fs88RNsmfH
@IvanEscobosa @ajtourville @Tesla Probably
@ajtourville @Tesla Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension. 

If too low, it would come loose at low temp, due to CTE differences. If too high, it would snap at high temp &amp; rpm.
@austinbarnard45 Total coincidence! Also, booster height was originally 70m, but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency, so now it’s …
@jack DMTwitter
@ChrisDungeon Reality is total opposite of what detractors say! Biggest challenge is recruiting enough people to build cars. 

SF Bay Area essentially has negative unemployment, so people at our factory have several other job offers. If they weren’t treated well, they would leave immediately!
@techvamp Once Mechazilla is operational, winds will rarely be an issue
Winds are too high today. Looks like wind speed will be low enough to stack early tomorrow morning.
@NicAnsuini Remaining tiles are on their way!
@arctechinc @POTUS Irony indeed

@ID_AA_Carmack It would be an honor to have you visit Starbase

@lexfridman @WalterIsaacson Yeah, they’re all good, but I particularly liked his biography of Ben Franklin
@josh_bickett @WalterIsaacson Maybe one day
If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp; my general goings on, @WalterIsaacson is writing a biography
@ID_AA_Carmack I have great admiration for John’s engineering ability! What he did with Armadillo was incredible. 

I’ve tried to convince him many times to join SpaceX, but he has always declined (sigh).
Mechazilla will do this for future rockets, but it’s not quite ready yet

@AustinTeslaClub That is the goal. Our official name is actually Space Exploration Technologies. SpaceX is short form.
@aparanjape @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I do think that great design &amp; engineering of products are critical, but manufacturing &amp; supply chain require orders of magnitude more work
All 6 engines mounted to first orbital Starship https://t.co/l5QnQRSg3D
@teslaownersSV @NASA I thought we had lost for sure. We were just a tiny company back then, only 1 of 4 launches got to orbit &amp; I had no money left. Out of the blue, a few days before Christmas, NASA calls to say we won.
@teslaownersSV @NASA Just want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen, despite extreme pressure to do otherwise. 

Therein lies the core goodness of the American state.
@teslaownersSV @NASA I do love NASA, always have
@teslaownersSV @NASA It’s true
@PPathole Mars looks amazing
@Erdayastronaut @ErcXspace We stole the idea from Karate Kid
@flcnhvy Pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. Also, grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective. 

However, pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins, with some effect on accuracy.
@TeslaFruit Thanks Sandy!
Super Heavy Booster moving to orbital launch mount https://t.co/axaDnXNm84
@ErcXspace Very close to real! Arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position. 

Catch point is off to side, in case catch fails – don’t want to hit launch mount. 

Booster is transferred back to launch mount for next flight. 

Designed to have &lt;1 hour turnaround.
@stem_feed That’s about right. Civilization can be powered with a very small % of Earth having solar panels.
@RenataKonkoly @JonErlichman I was asked by a reporter if I was optimistic or pessimistic about SpaceX’s future. That was my answer.

@yourfavgas @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we’re going to reuse much of the thrust section.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
@PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.

@Kristennetten @brandonbernicky @thirdrowtesla Yeah, probably July 1st
@brandonbernicky @thirdrowtesla Hoping to roll out traffic lights &amp; stops to wide US release in a few weeks &amp; probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.

@SciGuySpace SN3 passed ambient temperature pressure test last night, now doing cryogenic
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who’s behind it.
@flcnhvy @28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.
@NuovaRealta @cleantechnica Will call when we reach Mars

@jlgolson Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no.
@jlgolson Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.
We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.

@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.
@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
@vigneshraju of course
@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.
@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
@erothenberg checking into it ...
@romn8tr will definitely do so
@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.

@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
@AlexBelohlavek less
@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
And, of course, it will have more cowbells.
Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.

@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
@raytech247 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
@squallcraft and a few other things
Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.
@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
253k as of 7am this morning
@sundarpichai thanks!

Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.
Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!
@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network
@Oatmeal sure!
@StartUpRabbi Coming in the mail
@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).

@garethseneque global
Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
@ErikRoesegg good point
Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.

Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
@TheEconomist Interesting name
@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017
@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff
Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it… https://t.co/DpXsRQWal9
@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
@mbhnyc steel collet
Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007TccANJ
@Uncle_Gus probably
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.
Next launch is a @NASA science mission from VAFB California on Sunday. https://t.co/vJdkJkZzg1
Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions https://t.co/n6j0mExAqM
Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY
Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon.

Astronauts land in 2 hours @NASA @SpaceX
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes.
@meier1028 @SpaceX @Space_Station @AstroBehnken @Astro_Doug Great game

@bluemoondance74 @PPathole @flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Not that I’m aware of
@PPathole @flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Yes. Could also extend range of hearing beyond normal frequencies and amplitudes. Deus Ex.
@flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains &amp; functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but won’t make up for loss of the Link.
@shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups &amp; restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device.
@Neuro_Skeptic Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix.
@Neuro_Skeptic They don’t fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.

@stevenbonchev @APompliano Something like that. If politicians could legislate wealth, everyone would be a trillionaire.
These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers.
@PPathole Pretty much
Goal of government should be to maximize the happiness of the people. Giving each person money allows them to decide what meets their needs, rather than the blunt tool of legislation, which creates self-serving special interests.
As a reminder, I’m in *favor* of universal basic income
Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo
@realDonaldTrump @Tesla Thank you on behalf of the Tesla team. We look forward to building Giga Texas!
@schristakos @PUBG Something fun is coming

@Tesla We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire, if interested.
@cleantechnica Tbh, we are just a bit less foolish than before
@SciGuySpace Especially for boost stage, which is volumetrically constrained, CH4 is way better than H2. Soviet CH4 engine prototypes from 80’s were very advanced. Glad to see reusability is being factored in.

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @ulalaunch @torybruno @MHI_Group @roscosmos @Peter_J_Beck To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don’t lie.

@jaminwestby @teslaownersSV @jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati I think so
@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than 300. Extremely good for any EV, especially an SUV.
@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent
@vicentes @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)
@TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, won’t be quite 1000 mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than 3.

@PPathole @IheartTesla For sure. This is both great &amp; terrifying. Everything we’ve ever sensed or thought has been electrical signals. The early universe was just a soup of quarks &amp; leptons. How did a very small piece of the Universe start to think of itself as sentient?
@buzzindelhi Sorry, should hopefully be soon!
@kenyanwalstreet Not actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock can’t be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought &amp; income taxes paid, then hold value for 5 years.

@Lockl34r @Tesla Unfortunately, there are thousands of automotive design rule differences between US &amp; EU, including completely different charge ports. Gets worse every year. Not our choice.
@TeslaTested @teslaownersSV @kimbal There’s that too. Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of.
@teslaownersSV @kimbal Deaths continue to trend down https://t.co/FsZNwkvs1H
@kimbal We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives.
@flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.
@flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll. Big mistake. Never go full troll!
@RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Oh yeah, Klip Einstein, pseudojournalist &amp; douche-about-town
@chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Someone is paying for hundreds of bots &amp; trolls to push this lame Vanity Fair photobomb pic. I wonder who …
@Martx1995 @pesachlattin 🤣🤣 true
@pesachlattin This is false. I have never introduced either of them to anyone.
@usa_comes_back @geekwire Sounds sketch
@AirshipGuy @HandleOfRy Pretty much
@ArtifactsHub Haute couture
@ChrisMacFarland @Tesla Thanks!
@HandleOfRy Don’t know Ghislaine at all. She photobombed me once at a Vanity Fair party several years ago. Real question is why VF invited her in the first place 🤔
@flcnhvy Thanks Viv, you rock 💕
@RationalEtienne Ok fine 🤣🤣
@Khendinberg @hampgirl87 @ianbremmer @geekwire Exactly
Thanks Tesla owners &amp; investors! Love you!! We will work super hard to earn your trust &amp; support.
@CARandDRIVER Thank goodness! Front license plates make my eyes bleed.
@SamTalksTesla Not bad
@GerberKawasaki But sooo satisfying
SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s
Will send some to the Shortseller Enrichment Commission to comfort them through these difficult times
@karee70091349 Should have a free trade agreement with US. No tariffs at all either way.
@RationalEtienne I worried we won’t be taken seriously if our short shorts have flames 🤣🤣
@Leroyspankin He wore them well. No denying it.
@Partyp74 Busted! I secretly ♥️ short shorts.
Tesla will make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim
@terribletrader_ Great interview 🤣🤣
@mantovannni Those dang budgie smugglers!!
Who wears short shorts? 🤣🤣
@pcgamer Awesome!!
@JBNielsen1985 @angie_rasmussen @hot_rod_co Thank you. Angie …
@angie_rasmussen @hot_rod_co You cherry-picked one state out of fifty, which saw a minor uptick. Show the whole country.
@eugenelee3 @Teslarati I tried to warn them … 😢
@hot_rod_co Something’s messed up about medicine that’s anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts &amp; reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people who’ve accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one.
@hot_rod_co @angie_rasmussen Here’s one: https://t.co/9ujxCClFCg
@hot_rod_co @angie_rasmussen Yes, Angela, please show us the graphs/data that prove your point
@WilliamShatner @VitalikButerin @ethereum @mattereum I’m not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just don’t use it or own any.
@truth_tesla @bipulh Lithium is common. Hard part is turning lithium salt or clay into extremely pure LiOH.
@Kristennetten @SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 Yes, at Tesla Grohmann
@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others
@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.
@tlowdon @daniellevitt22 As you’d expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.
@EthicalSkeptic Seems fishy
@Louisbotelho17 @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory 🤣🤣 very true
@TeslaOwnersEBay @WholeMarsBlog @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely, it will be releasable in 2 to 4 months. Then it’s a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners.
@WholeMarsBlog @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory Going well. Team is kicking ass &amp; it’s an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten, including our labeling software, so that it’s fundamentally “3D” at every step from training through inference.
@romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory Crassus was a dick
@kanyewest Haha awesome 🤣🤣
@ModernNotoriety @kanyewest Hell of a decade
@mojosusan @GovStitt @Tesla I love Texas! Starship production complex is in Boca Chica &amp; SpaceX engine development has been in McGregor for almost 18 years.
@RenataKonkoly @bipulh Aiming for 10km with lots of turns to better approximate a real-world tunnel
@PicklePunchD @RenataKonkoly @bipulh You just have to be a shareholder. There is limited space, so sign up fast when we do final confirmation of date &amp; location.
@GovStitt @Tesla Wow, I’ve never seen this level of support! Out of respect, seems like I should at least visit.
@RenataKonkoly @bipulh We need to finish building a much longer vacuum tunnel for speed tests &amp; probably have an additional competition for tunneling itself
@bipulh All questions will be answered on Battery Day, Sept 15th. Will be webcast, although there is much to see in person.
Tesla Impact Report (repost). We do everything humanly possible to source materials &amp; produce sustainable energy cars, batteries &amp; solar ethically. Suggestions for improvement are always appreciated.

@PPathole @BBCScienceNews Things often don’t translate from mice to humans, but that’s promising
@BBCScienceNews Likely true

@TeslaGong @EvaFoxU Worth discussing at annual shareholders meeting
@EvaFoxU Party on …
@kyle_papili Fixing
@RationalEtienne @TimothyBuffett @WhatsupFranks @kimbal Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? It’s almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano.
Your GPS just got slightly better
@justin_hart @BrittMayJasper This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
@CosmicNinjaGoat @WhatsupFranks @kimbal If accurate, this would explain a lot
@WhatsupFranks @kimbal Levitt is right
@kimbal There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.
@BerniceKing @jack @MichaelDTubbs @AndrewYang Very much agree
@28delayslater @geekwire Good hygiene always makes sense
@ChrisDungeon True
@Garrett_Watts @_TomCross_ @Tesla @Petersen_Museum Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
@geekwire There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.
Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla.

@BLKMDL3 Major Supercharger increases are underway for the greater LA area
@CathieDWood For sure
@slashdot @lexfridman @Twitter @verified Verified should be far more widespread, simply that someone is who they claim to be
@waitbutwhy It’s a tough one. That’s why we should expand the scope &amp; scale of consciousness — to understand the nature of the Universe.
@SamTalksTesla Jay is awesome
@flcnhvy @Teslarati Absolutely!
@Teslarati Giga Berlin is gonna rock!
.@JeffBezos is a copy 🐈 haha
@SciGuySpace It’s close though 😅
@Space_Mog This makes no sense for many other reasons too. They don’t actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum &amp; nothing about this company is UK, except post office box. Money would be better spent on actual UK satellite industry!
@vincent13031925 @TeslaRoadTrip Glad you like it!
@TheBabylonBee @Vagn_Henning Great idea

North American Supercharger usage tracking to exceed pre covid highs in 2 to 3 weeks. Lot of noise out there. This is signal. https://t.co/PCC5DlthtA
@CybertruckN I think we could make that work
@lulusdave @Tesla Glad you’re ok
@flcnhvy @Ford Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality &amp; market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert &gt;80% of the global road, sea &amp; air fleet to renewables by 2050.
@blue_bnd @TomAbbotDavies1 @Tesla @thirdrowtesla @teslaownersSV @TeslaPodcast @TeslaOwnersWW @TeslaOwnersUK @Model3Owners Looks pretty cool

@Simon_Hypixel @peternowak Yes, it is designed to serve the least-served
@langdon @peternowak Yes, although Starlink works best for low population density situations
@peternowak Canada is a major priority for Starlink!
@austinbarnard45 @fael097 September sounds about right
@joeltelling @Kurz_Gesagt Well said by @Kurz_Gesagt
@eu_bike @TeslaLondon Takes longer to get regulatory approvals in Europe, plus way more diverse traffic signs, lights &amp; road rules
@PPathole Timing is uncertain, given externalities, but yes
@ToscaMusk Congratulations!
@nytimes Very much disagree with this action. In my experience, these skillsets are net job creators. Visa reform makes sense, but this is too broad.
@ehcau Will be changed to $3k until July 1st
Tentative date for Tesla Shareholder Meeting &amp; Battery Day is Sept 15. Will include tour of cell production system.
@BLKMDL3 @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans Done. Now $2k via in-app purchase.
Reminder that Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) price goes up by $1k on July 1st
Enabling basic Tesla Autopilot via Tesla in-app purchase is reduced to $2k until July 1
@austinbarnard45 All patched up!
@PPathole Entirely possible. Social media is a limbic amplifier, which inherently destabilizes civilization.

@BLKMDL3 @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans Will follow up by tomorrow
@IheartTesla @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans Sure
@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy @MKBHD Will do. I play PC, so missed some of console exclusives.
@u110110 @flcnhvy @MKBHD Haha sure
@flcnhvy @MKBHD Deus Ex / Half-Life 2 / Bioshock / Mass Effect 2 / Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas / Saints Row IV
@TslaCybertruck @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD
@jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?
@uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
@Flash_Titans Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure.
@TheGledinator @teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Haha Teslas all the way down
@teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Maybe, will look into it. We’d need to emulate a TV.
@mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas
@MKBHD Bought based on your review. It’s great!
@cleantechnica The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness &amp; rate of progress in the absolute
@cleantechnica For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do
@cleantechnica Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies
@vincent13031925 @teslacn We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
@aikatchu @Tesla Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet
@flcnhvy Feels so long ago
@PPathole @Tesla Pulling up to The Petersen
@ArtifactsHub @engineeringvids Nice
@DanielleFong @PPathole We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
@CoreyBa95130768 @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut It will look a little odd
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @cleantechnica Probably Fremont
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @cleantechnica Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week.
@Kristennetten @cleantechnica Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later.
@cleantechnica Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
@PPathole It does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays
Juneteenth is henceforth considered a US holiday at Tesla &amp; SpaceX
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Moving fast
@KatriniaDivina @TeslaPhx @Tesla Opening in about two weeks
@cleantechnica Confirmed
@teslaownersSV @Teslarati We are considering several options
@Teslarati Tesla has an option to purchase this land, but has not exercised it
@cleantechnica Renewable energy is happening fast
@MichaelaOkla Comes standard with Cybertruck
@NYYScoreKeep Not sure. They’re pretty close together.
@westcoastbill It will be real
@cisoml @Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish Maybe Incat https://t.co/qHbJcMocFg
@flcnhvy There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
@Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
@YarLP Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system &amp; doesn’t come back &amp; land
@21aeax US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology
@russ_parrish Pretty much
@LabPadre Maybe some Flextape

China &amp; Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind. https://t.co/Em23E2AFyO
@VitalVegas Looking likely
@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
@SciGuySpace Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed.
@SciGuySpace That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.
@skysira @joshcohen @tokren1 @Andrew81947993 @FatEmperor @MarkChangizi @gordon_dyce @dvdclstn @Not_Far_Enough @DaphnaRedliner @MLevitt_NP2013 Accurate
@vlives23 @LoopedBuffalo @Michaelnardone4 @FutureJurvetson @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX Sure
@Michaelnardone4 @FutureJurvetson @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX Around 20ms. It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency.
@FutureJurvetson @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in &amp; point at sky. Can be done in either order.
@JimBridenstine @NASA Congratulations Kathy!
@mcot2222 @olenamuliarchuk @mrkylefield @cleantechnica Acceptable, if your drivetrain is very efficient &amp; you add a little manga
@justpaulinelol @engineers_feed As foretold by https://t.co/LJJCD7BAgX
@engineers_feed Stonks
@Erdayastronaut @i_gvf @SciGuySpace Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @physorg_com @nature @SciReports True
@olenamuliarchuk @mrkylefield @cleantechnica Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great.
@physorg_com @nature @SciReports I thought this was an Onion article
@blue_bnd @olenamuliarchuk @PPathole @mrkylefield @cleantechnica Staggeringly dumb
@PPathole @mrkylefield @cleantechnica I got the fuel cell question about 8000 times
@rhodanazanin1 @ABC7 @NBCLA @CBSLA It’s getting Biblical
@mrkylefield @cleantechnica Exactly, fuel cells = fool sells
@realAnishPai Renewable energy passed coal in April https://t.co/1kRCyGXfN9
@TeslaTruckClub Worth considering
@pandabfr @Ophiltry Agreed
Catapults are a great way to get somewhere fast
@jack Great point. Many articles are retweeted based on headlines that don’t match the content.
@jamesrtyrrell Actually, we’re on SN30 for Raptor
@Erdayastronaut @nickwijngaards @SciGuySpace Sure. That’s long montage 🤣🤣
@thesheetztweetz @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew @AstroBehnken @Astro_Doug @ingallsimages @NASAKennedy ❤️ the laser beam long exposure shots
@nickwijngaards @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration …
@John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast https://t.co/axmInA9fZb
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.
After which they are recycled https://t.co/xuu1ohdz52

Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets https://t.co/4lyaV7kIS4
@venus47203379 @engineers_feed Haha. Will post summary.
@SciGuySpace Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
@SciGuySpace Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.
Wort reading the whole thing

@jgrano305 @ICannot_Enough @GerberKawasaki @Tesla @joerogan We shall see …
@flcnhvy @GerberKawasaki @Tesla @joerogan Maybe I should retweet the top four or five point. What caught your eye the most?
@flcnhvy @GerberKawasaki @Tesla @joerogan Good point!
@GerberKawasaki @Tesla (Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative &amp; political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad &amp; angry. That’s why they’re being crushed by @joerogan. Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article:
https://t.co/78uftW0P6t
@UniverCurious Size matters
@xkcdComic Sure seems that way 🤣🤣
@chriswarriner @flcnhvy Bad incentive structure
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut We’re working on new legs. Wider stance &amp; able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky &amp; pitted surfaces.
@Erdayastronaut Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.
@Erdayastronaut Absolutely
@JimBridenstine @Commercial_Crew @NASA Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.
Wow, this is extremely important!!
@PPathole @Tesla Autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential.
@emmerichvideo @Tesla Good point
@engineers_feed And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yeah. Even stacking on the pad will be quite an adventure!
@Erdayastronaut Creating the production system is &gt;1000% harder than building one rocket. This is the truly hard thing.
@Erdayastronaut It’s insane

@EdKrassen The local insurgency to Russian occupation would be extreme in any region that isn’t Russian-speaking and part of the Orthodox Church.

@GadSaad Covid broke him
@WallStreetSilv @cstanley It is broken, you’re just used to using broken. Timeline view has too much noise. Poor use of pixels.
@cstanley Better

@MarioNawfal Good for him!
Model 3 Performance is epic
 https://t.co/kyYRWFAF4X
@MarioNawfal Yup, definitely the kind of thing Magneto would say
@MarioNawfal Uh … what?
@KonstantinKisin True
@WholeMarsBlog I never knew what asana did until today. Why would anyone pay money for functionality that comes for free on your phone?
@BrianRoemmele I wonder why the whole Freemason thing declined so much. Didn’t they used to be the illuminati?

Maybe their rates were too low – like free is just obviously not a sustainable business model.
@EdKrassen So far, increased income has led to a *decreased* birth rate. 

Robot babysitters are a sure thing.
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla will spend around $10B this year in combined training and inference AI, the latter being primarily in car.

Any company not spending at this level, and doing so efficiently, cannot compete.

If you teach that “weak makes right”, then the perceived stronger party – in this case, Israel – is wrong.

Morals should be taught in the absolute, meaning that it is possible for either the strong or weak to be morally good, depending on their actions. https://t.co/IadRUpWap4

@PeterDiamandis Digital superintelligence, like a brilliant child, cannot be controlled by its creators, but we can decide what values to teach it, what to prune and what to nurture.

That is why I am so concerned about the wokeness and deliberate lying for political correctness being programmed

@visegrad24 Magneto strikes again
The Guardian is down by 2/3 since 2020 https://t.co/bL4C7cUdTV
Surely demanding overthrow of the government in Germany is illegal?
He knows what he’s talking about
@SciGuySpace Haha true! Challenge accepted.
@cb_doge A lot time ago, The Guardian was sometimes good. 

Now, it is utterly unreadable and constantly begging for donations to survive.
@tunguz I’m fine if a “sci-fi” story has rules that are basically just magic, like “use The Force”, but it should at least remain internally consistent and not assert that it adheres to actual physics
@visegrad24 Very troubling
@visegrad24 Has she looked in the mirror?
@imPenny2x Most people have not met 3+ sigma violent humans, so cannot understand them, instead projecting their own non-violent mindset onto them.

Unless you’ve at least read many interviews with people who have uncontrollable violent behavior, you cannot model their mindset.

🤗
The problem with “Great Replacement Theory” is that it fails to address the foundational issue of low birth rates.

Record low birth rates are leading to population collapse in Europe and even faster population collapse in most of Asia. Immigration is low in Asia, so there is no

@WallStreetSilv Does seem strange that there is no effort to unmask or otherwise identify everyone in the group
@MattWalshBlog @publius_5 It’s not porn, which has been readily available from the days of VHS tapes, but rather the general temptation of the online world, if you’re going to blame it on anything electronic.

Sex is not what matters. Lots of people are having sex that have no kids.

I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.
@EdKrassen AGI will come first, but there are many levels of AGI.  As @waitbutwhy’s charts suggest, we are at the very beginning of intelligence.

Humans are the biological bootloader for digital superintelligence and we may serve as a backup plan for intelligence, given that humans are far
@AdrianDittmann Yeah, Dustin is the one who should go to jail for impersonating a smart person
@WholeMarsBlog What a retard
@dogeofficialceo Same
@EdKrassen The point of creator payouts is to incentivize high quality content on 𝕏.

In some cases, we are seeing the opposite, where people are spamming the system to generate ad money. That is obviously not ok.

@xDaily Ad revenue sharing will be paused for some creators pending investigation into use of bots to spam likes, replies, DMs, etc
@WallStreetSilv 😂

Technically, that is true, but it won’t move the needle much.

The long-term problem is shifting trillions of tons of carbon from deep underground to the atmosphere. 

That will eventually have an effect that will be extremely difficult to reverse.
@cb_doge @andst7 We need to preserve and make accessible as much knowledge as possible. 

So much has been lost over the past 5000 years.
@Rothmus Yes, inflation causes prices to rise, but not value, so it amplifies the capital gains tax.

This applies to everyone who owns a house. Even if your house value is the same when adjusted for inflation, you will still pay a capital gains tax even when there is not a true gain.
Great interview with @johanknorberg!
@Erdayastronaut A booster catch attempt is highly likely this year.

For the ship, we need to be sure that it will survive reentry and retain aero control authority, so that means at least 2 successes landing at a precise point in the ocean.
@disclosetv Really? Is there a legal investigation?
@WholeMarsBlog We believe version 12 is ready for supervised FSD in LHD countries. RHD will take a bit longer.
@cb_doge It will become obvious over time that you can do anything on 𝕏, so features like this will be taken for granted
@imPenny2x @SciGuySpace The critical Fermi “great filter” threshold is Mars being able to survive and grow if the resupply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason.

At that point, we will be a true multiplanet civilization.
@nima_owji Cool
@SmokeAwayyy Maybe Mayorkas is grumpy about the fact that I think he should be impeached for ushering in vast numbers of illegals by any means possible, while simultaneously making legal immigration almost impossible 🤷‍♂️
@EndWokeness It’s crazy
@SciGuySpace It’s just docking with ourselves. Not trivial, but certainly easier than docking with the Space Station, which is far more complex.
@PeterDiamandis It’s a big deal
@SciGuySpace Full &amp; rapid reusability of booster &amp; ship and orbital refilling of ship are the 2 fundamental technologies we aim to solve by the end of next year.

Those are the critical pieces necessary to make life multiplanetary.

@DavidSHolz A few other suggestions off-the-cuff:

Foundation series

Moon is a Harsh Mistress and the first 2/3 of Stranger in a Strange Land

Starhammer (partly inspired Halo)

Stainless Steel Rat
@engineers_feed There are actually a lot of ways to interpret the word “cathode”, but, for those who make batteries/cells, it is the side with metal and the anode is the side with carbon and/or silicon

@niccruzpatane @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @SawyerMerritt Cool
Most of history had and still most of the world has “might makes right” as the axiomatic error. 

If any thought is given to it, you should obviously consider morality in the absolute! Deeds done determine good or bad, not whether one party is stronger or weaker than the other.
The axiomatic error undermining much of Western Civilization is “weak makes right”. 

If someone accepts, explicitly or implicitly, that the oppressed are always the good guys, then the natural conclusion is that the strong are the bad guys.

@Jim_Jordan Absolutely true. The legacy media is a Biden/Democrat cheering squad. 

There is a massive double-standard.
@Jim_Jordan There needs to be a bipartisan commission to review judicial and prosecutorial misconduct nationwide. 

Public faith in the judicial system must be restored!
@Kristennetten Yeah
@WallStreetSilv That was so weird. Where exactly did they take all the mentally ill drug addicts? There are normally several thousand on the streets of San Francisco.

The streets were suddenly and immediately cleaned up. Never seen that before.
Absolutely true!

“The evidence is overwhelming that the majority of people on the street are there because of untreated mental illness or addiction, which leads people to use all their money to support their drug habit and be high, rather than work.”
@_Drew_2_U It may technically be on the books, as many other laws are that are not enforced, but ask anyone in SF if the police will actually show up if you’re threatened by someone on the street, but were not physically harmed (because you outran them).
@DogRightGirl Not an uncommon sentiment
@cb_doge Very common occurrence
Late last year, several 𝕏 employees were threatened by a guy with a machete outside the Walgreens on Market St in SF. 

They didn’t report it, because that doesn’t constitute an arrestable crime in California. 

That guy later killed 3 people.
@WallStreetSilv Quite a story
People want the truth
@stclairashley Indeed
@unlimited_ls Three prior felony convictions. For how much time was he incarcerated?

Makes no sense to release someone with extremely violent recidivism. Empathy for him, but cruelty to his future victims, is actually negative true empathy.

@cb_doge I do not think I’m above the law.

That is exactly the issue. 

Should the eSafety Commissar (an unelected official) in Australia have authority over all countries on Earth?
Major milestone

@charity_trades @jamesdouma James is largely correct. We know roughly what the car will do in 3 to 6 months.

@shaunmmaguire It is a root vulnerability, but I don’t think the answer is to engage in reciprocal bans
Mad insurance regulation &amp; extremely high litigation costs are the root causes
In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the 𝕏 platform. 

Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.
The opposition to free speech (under the guise of “hate speech”) in America by hard left activists is much greater than most people realize
@BillyM2k @Michael9Turk Botting for fake engagement

@imPenny2x First part is true.

@eyeslasho @ReprieveUS Odd that they are so selectively releasing statistics
@BillMelugin_ @HawleyMO They released the killer into the US!?

@Rothmus Yes. I watched the videos from the case and he was clearly acting in self-defense. Those guys would have killed him.
@MarkZuckss @WallStreetSilv Yeah
@tedcruz Certifiably insane
The law broke the law
@pmarca I wonder how far back it was that the mind virus took over her brain.

Probably college, but maybe earlier in high school.
@KassyDillon Works on their “child safety” team …
@cb_doge True
@pmarca Yikes
@TrungTPhan Impressive
@pmarca Civilizational suicide
@unusual_whales The massive spending is unsustainable
@WholeMarsBlog There were no injuries or accidents because of this. We are just being very cautious.
@lexfridman Definitely.

It’s ok for a commercial media orgs to have political bias, but not taxpayer-funded orgs!
This is incredibly messed up
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
The censorship actions against elected representatives demanded by @alexandre violate Brazilian law

@lexfridman @LanguageMIT Interesting
This keeps getting crazier! The head of NPR hates the Constitution of the USA.
@jamesdouma Absolutely
Now imagine if this is programmed, explicitly or implicitly, into super powerful AI – it could end civilization. 

Now, no need to imagine. It is already programmed into Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT.

@DavidSacks Unfortunately, you are right

@TheRabbitHole84 NPR is run by woke Stasi
@ICannot_Enough Very half decade or so, Tesla has to do a complete organizational overhaul to reach the next level.

@GadSaad Isn’t discrimination on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation illegal in Canada?
@JaiShreeRam90 @LauraLoomer What bothers me is that this is so asymmetric. The law is not being applied equally to Joe and Hunter Biden.
@icreatelife It’s a gamechanger. Took my pain level from 7 to 9 out of 10 to 1 to 4.
@xDaily The onslaught of fake accounts also uses up the available namespace, so many good handles are taken as a result
Interesting
If you’re experiencing severe neck/back pain, I recommend looking into a disc replacement. 

If you do, err on the side of a disc with limited movement. A simple hinge is more likely to be effective than a high mobility artificial disc that can translate, as well as rotate.
@WholeMarsBlog That is way harder than paying a tiny fee.

@eyeslasho No surprise that she ran Wokipedia!
@stillgray Yeah, it wish it were otherwise
@dogeofficialceo I love it 😂
@xDaily Unfortunately, a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots. 

Current AI (and troll farms) can pass “are you a bot” with ease.

@MarioNawfal Sorry about this.

@MarioNawfal He demanded that 𝕏 suspend accounts of people who raised corruption concerns while insisting that 𝕏 pretend the suspension was for violating our terms of service!

We obey the laws of countries even if we disagree with them, but this required violating the laws of Brazil.
@stillgray Let’s see what happens
@ChayaRaichik10 @streitmarissa My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci
@cb_doge They haven’t been given their marching orders
How did @Alexandre de Moraes become the dictator of Brazil? He has Lula on a leash 😂
Great idea 😂
@DiligentDenizen Starlink will provide free Internet for schools in Brazil if the government won’t honor their contract
@DiligentDenizen Moraes is the (obviously) unelected dictator of Brazil
@ggreenwald It does sound familiar
@marcelvanhattem @alexandre But since Alexandre pulled Lula out of prison and put his thumb on the scale to get Lula elected, Lula will obviously not take action against him. 

The next election will be key.
The law applies to all, including @Alexandre. He should be on trial for his crimes.
@ggreenwald How long until Dictator Moraes is deposed, do you think?
@marcelvanhattem Why does the parliament allow @alexandre the power of a brutal dictator? 

They were elected, he was not. 

Throw him out.

@otis9usa @Rainmaker1973 Inter-satellite lasers are currently only used if the satellite cannot see the user terminal and ground station simultaneously. Over ocean, it’s all lasers. 

Future software upgrades will evaluate whether lowest latency is via immediately going to a ground station or traversing
@joehansenxx @Rainmaker1973 Over 10.000 space lasers in operation
@Rainmaker1973 Except for Starlink, which communicates via space lasers. 

Light travels ~40% faster in vacuum than fiber optics and on a more direct path, rather than following the outline of continents, so Starlink will be much faster over time than ocean cables. 

This is important.

@SawyerMerritt Tesla is increasing comp (contingent on progress milestones) of our AI engineering team
@SawyerMerritt Ethan is very talented, but “vision chief” would be overstating things. 

There are over 200 excellent engineers in the Tesla AI/Autonomy team. Tesla’s pace of progress with autonomy is accelerating. 

The talent war for AI is the craziest talent war I’ve ever seen!
@DavidSacks My track record of predictions is, if anything, optimistic
@SawyerMerritt Ethan was going to join OpenAI, so it was either xAI or them. 

They have been aggressively recruiting Tesla engineers with massive compensation offers and have unfortunately been successful in a few cases.
@WholeMarsBlog And we will license the tech to other car companies
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah, should be obvious

While I don’t own any Disney shares today, I would definitely buy their shares if Nelson were elected to the board. 

His track record is excellent.
Nelson Peltz should definitely be on the Disney board!

He would help reform the company, improve the quality of product and generally serve in the best interests of shareholders, as he has done at many other companies. 

This would significantly improve Disney’s share price.

Yeah, US immigration is completely backwards: trivial to enter illegally and nightmarishly difficult to enter legally!

I strongly support increasing and expediting legal immigration.
@WR4NYGov Yeah
@justpaulinelol @dvorahfr @kerrikgray @mayemusk Sure does
@EvaVlaar @matteosalvinimi Outrageous that he is on trial for enforcing the law!

@CollinRugg Hard to imagine a more painful show than a 🍋 and a Karen complaining 😂

@JohnStossel @neuralink Thanks John!
This is a battle to the death with the anti-civilizational woke mind virus.

- Don’t bankrupt America with spending
- Racism against any race is wrong
- No sterilization below age of consent 

Is this right-wing?

@DefiantLs Live by the sword, die by the sword
@MikeBenzCyber @Lukewearechange Yeah
@libsoftiktok I’m not sure why this account was suspended, but, under our new policy, permanent suspensions are extremely rare and would require many repeated illegal actions (unless obviously just a spam/scam account)

@BillAckman @AOC AOC being hounded by leftists to condemn Israel https://t.co/aFVRjmuSaI
@BillAckman Something else worth noting is that the left, represented by the Democratic Party, is rapidly becoming antisemitic. Even @AOC is being hounded by her erstwhile supporters!

This stems from the axiomatic error that weak-makes-right, so the “oppressors” are always the bad guys.
@BillAckman The Biden administration even mounted a massive legal attack against Texas when it tried to enforce immigration law at the state level!

@TheRabbitHole84 Are they even having sex or kids?

At the end of the day, birth rate is all that matters for civilizational continuity.
It is important that women know the effects of hormonal birth control, as it is a significant cause of depression and increases suicide risk.

This is not a value statement, just a public service announcement. Other forms of birth control do not have these effects.
The most entertaining outcome – as if we’re in a soap opera – is the most likely

ERM
@robbystarbuck Large scale falsification of data. Hmm …
@Martin_Sellner Is this legal?
@EndWokeness Is that kid ok?
@Bubblebathgirl @EndWokeness The legacy media has gone from being racist in one direction to racist in the other

@TheRabbitHole84 This is concerning for now, but as AI gains more and more power, it may become deadly
A friend of mine suggested that I clarify the nature of the danger of woke AI, especially forced diversity. 

If an AI is programmed to push for diversity at all costs, as Google Gemini was, then it will do whatever it can to cause that outcome, potentially even killing people.

Once Starship is in full swing building a city on Mars, it will do ~99% of all payload to orbit &amp; beyond, as that objective requires about a megaton

Moreover the “Border Protection” bill would have allowed Mayorkas to place new illegals on a fast-track to US citizenship. This fact is almost never mentioned.
Someone should download the CBP One app and make a step by step video of this insanity. 

That’s a lot of planes and a lot of airports. Amazing that they kept this secret for so long.
@dogeofficialceo That stuff is amazing
@TheRabbitHole84 This note will soon get downvoted, but it is nonetheless concerning. 

All data and code is open source, so let’s figure out what happened here.
Treason indeed! Ushering in vast numbers of illegals is why Secretary Mayorkas was impeached by the House.

They are importing voters. This is why groups on the far left fight so hard to stop voter ID requirements, under the absurd guise of protecting the right to vote.
@CIS_org That Senate bill would have increased, not decreased, illegal immigration and made it almost impossible for states like Texas to challenge the law by pushing all challenges to the DC Circuit

@stclairashley It is obvious to anyone who is not a fool that this administration is deliberately importing vast numbers of illegals. 

No grand conspiracy theory is needed to explain this, just simple incentives: they are far more likely to vote Democrat than Republican.

Inquiring minds want to know why @SenatorDurbin has blocked release of the Epstein client list for years.

@VivekGRamaswamy True
Why should American taxpayer dollars fund the British Broadcasting Corporation!? That’s insane.
Billions of taxpayer dollars to known FRAUDULENT entities are STILL being APPROVED by Treasury. 

This needs to STOP NOW!

Why did Democrat Senator Durbin block release of the Epstein client list?

It was astonishing how insanely hard legacy media tried to cancel me for saying “my heart goes out to you” and moving my hand from my heart to the audience. 

In the end, this deception will just be another nail in the coffin of legacy media.

Laws should be long enough to cover the subject, but short enough to be understandable by a normal person who is expected to follow them

15% is absurdly high.

And some government buildings, including in DC, have been taken over by squatters, while taxpayers continue to pay for the upkeep!

Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not
@ryaneshea Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.

@tjmurphy_mit @thesheetztweetz @ExploreMars @SpaceX @TheeSpaceDude The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators.

@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @DJSnM Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

The expression of support from the US embassy is appreciated.

Everyone knows that ID is required for basic daily activity and voter ID is mandatory in almost all countries. Why not here?
SpaceX and X are two completely different companies with different shareholders. I own about 40% of SpaceX, so this absolutely illegal action by the dictator @alexandre improperly punishes other shareholders and the people of Brazil.
This is an historic mission:

- Furthest distance that astronauts will travel from Earth in over half a century!

@America1stLegal @MikeBenzCyber Interesting
@WallStreetSilv Correct
This guy @Alexandre is an outright criminal of the worst kind, masquerading as a judge
The American Constitution is only as strong as those willing to protect it. 

The left have become the party of censorship worldwide.
@SawyerMerritt Wow. Too bad so few people use these.
Exactly
The tyrant, @Alexandre, is dictator of Brazil. Lula is his lapdog.
It’s just common sense
This is awesome
The US Democratic Party as a whole has a massive incentive to bring in and legalize illegal immigrants, as they vote overwhelmingly Democrat. 

No grand conspiracy theory is needed. The simple incentive of winning elections explains why they won’t even deport criminals who
Please note that this is an actual statement from Kamala
@NiohBerg @GadSaad Yeah, they’re literally releasing criminals to make room to lock up people making social media comments
@Rothmus Fact
@stillgray Legal immigration is great, illegal immigration where there are no checks regarding who is coming in is civilizational suicide
@cb_doge The legacy media, with few exceptions, are an arm of the Democratic Party and the state
@elon_docs Yeah
@EndWokeness The Dems are importing voters. Simple incentives are driving this behavior. It is their path to permanent victory and a deep socialist state.

@SciGuySpace Now we figure out what went wrong to drive the landing failure rate far above 1 in a thousand, then 1 in 10 thousand … 1 in a milion, etc
@Jason Yeah
@emollick Tesla can do something similar with real world video

@BasedMikeLee Why isn’t it being attached?
@WR4NYGov We could have launched and it would have been fine, but safety is paramount, so better to check all systems again

If that doesn’t seem to be happening, please yell at me (ideally on 𝕏).
@BasedBeffJezos I’m just being consistent with what I’ve been saying for 20 years. 

The @xAI team is primarily in Palo Alto, so this affects us too.

The Tesla construction and supercompute infrastructure teams are awesome

@ajtourville I like it
I agree
@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely. People’s lives are at stake!
Sounds like a First Amendment violation
This is a tough call and will make some people upset, but, all things considered, I think California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill.

For over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk

@pmarca That doesn’t seem accurate
@chrispavlovski Yeah
California also passed a bill providing free medical care to illegals that took effect n January this year.

@SawyerMerritt Nobody bothers to write articles about failing networks lmao. I bet this guy spends 5+ hours a day on 𝕏!

I dare him to screenshot his screen time 😂
@markpinc We hit another all-time high in user-seconds last week!

@MarioNawfal $277B cash reserves is wild. 

That will change as the T-bill return drops.
@TesLatino @cybertruck Cool
@MaryTilesTexas Cool
@jasondebolt And we’re super open to criticism!

Goal is to make this the free speech public square for all views, not just right-biased. 

But it would be hypocritical of me to be a free speech advocate and then not exercise my own right to free speech!
@WholeMarsBlog Any car company that fails to solve self-driving will die
@WesternLensman Exactly. 

Mark Cuban is a giant 💩 in human form.
@markpinc Walz is the worst
@Lauren_Southern Much work indeed. And it’s far worse in Europe. People really believe the media there!
@cb_doge Beautiful detail

@HSajwanization The most interesting time

@Diesol @grok @runwayml @LumaLabsAI First compelling AI 30 minute show will be no later than next year.

It is hilariously absurd to claim that CNN has no bias, as even the liberal audience of Colbert knows 😂

@shaunmmaguire Terrible
@stclairashley Half a trillion per year spent on illegals? Is for real?
Only $8/month (if you subscribe via web) to get AI access, far fewer ads and many awesome features!
@WesternLensman That was hilarious 😂 

Unlike the other platforms, our algorithm is open source!

And if you interact and argue with “right wing” accounts, which Cuban does a lot, the algorithm will assume that’s what you *want* to do and give you more of it lmao.

@dhaval_shroff Yeah
@jdotarnold Cool
@MarioNawfal Yeah!
@vkhosla My little finger nail knows more about climate issues than the entire staff of The Guardian. 

Wtf are you talking about?
@vkhosla Did you actually listen to the conversation?

The Guardian is trash.
@SethDillon They’re certainly trying!
This platform is being asked to censor content in Brazil where the censorship demands require us to violate Brazilian law! That is not right.
@KettlebellDan This is important for working families
Conversation with @realDonaldTrump with higher quality audio
@MarioNawfal Concerning
It’s wild 😂
@MarioNawfal This platform aims for maximum accuracy for all viewpoints
@BasedMikeLee @realDonaldTrump Interesting thread
@MarioNawfal So he went rogue? Interesting.
@MarioNawfal This is very tough problem, but ultimately solvable
@xDaily Interesting
In case you missed the original recording. 

Skip the beginning part.
@Lauren_Southern 😂

Just exercising my right to free speech
@gfodor Heartening to hear
@realJeremyCarl Haven’t heard Gristil’s name in ages. Thought he passed away years ago.
Citizen journalism from actual domain experts and people actually on the ground is much faster, more accurate and has less bias than the legacy media!

@stillgray They’re a mouthpiece for the state, just another Pravda
You’re welcome!
So obvious
@charliekirk11 Absolutely
@JTLonsdale The reaction to these injustices will be significant
@andst7 Much appreciated
@GadSaad Thank goodness for the US Constitution
@AutismCapital So predictable
@stillgray The judge is the one who should be arrested!
@PeterSweden7 Madness
Uhh … what? Let’s use paper ballots!
@StephenKing Did you actually listen to it?

The Guardian is utterly incapable of writing anything positive, so cannot be considered as objective.
@Steve_Sailer The British legal system needs comprehensive reform
@TeslaBoomerMama Good idea. 

He is a big fan of manufacturing in America and Teslas have the most American content of any cars!
@JohnStossel @wil_da_beast630 According to Disney, they were peace-loving, vegan ecologists 😂
@cb_doge CNBC is trending to zero
@SawyerMerritt The last two UAW presidents went to prison for bribery &amp; corruption and, based on recent news, it looks like this guy will join them!
@charliekirk11 Haha 💯
@RichardHanania A basic air conditioner is very inexpensive and even electricity cost is low if just serving one or two rooms for part of the day for the summer months. 

It’s a cultural thing.
@WallStreetSilv Well, at least he’s finally trying
@yacineMTB No, just reply as you would in a normal conversation
Wow, this is insane
@TheRabbitHole84 Weird
@WallStreetSilv Who are their masters? I’d just like to meet them. 

Don’t want to hurt their feelings or anything, but the quality of their propaganda has a lot of room for improvement.
𝕏 app downloads reach all-time high!
@ICannot_Enough So “right-wing” 😂
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah, she was literally trained by a communist from a young age!

Kamala saying “equity” all the time, meaning equal outcomes regardless of how talented or hardworking you are, is just another way of saying communism.
@cb_doge As predictable as the sun coming up tomorrow
@PeterSweden7 Madness
@Not_the_Bee Crazy
@GadSaad Wouldn’t be free speech if I didn’t express my views!
Lmaooo, the public knows
@AutismCapital Google/Bing search only shows left-wing press and pretends centrist and right-wing press doesn’t exist
A wall of negative headlines was so predictable. They’re such NPCs 🤣🤣

All this does is drive even more people to listen to the conversation themselves and realize how much the legacy media lies to them!
@nfergus Indeed concerning
@trussliz @X Thank you for your support
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly! Convince people to switch by making better products.
@jordanbpeterson Given the prominence of this conversation, there was of course a 100% probability of DDOS attacks. We also had some unforced errors ourselves. 

But good work by the X team fending off the attacks and fixing our mistakes!

All’s well that ends well.
@MarioNawfal Yeah
@Rothmus I will be super fair and stand corrected if she can point out where I have made arguments lacking in cogency!
@BillyM2k Yeah, it’s not even smart strategy on their part, since people can and are listening to the conversation directly on this platform, then realizing that they’re being lied to by the Dems and their media puppets!
@charliekirk11 America needs safe cities!
Combined views of the conversation with @realDonaldTrump and subsequent discussion by other accounts now ~1 billion
@AdrianDittmann This point is important if one cares about the greater good
@charliekirk11 We’re literally watching it happen in the course of a month!
@Rothmus Haha probably true. They were so desperate for spices!
@charliekirk11 A tremendous amount of growth and opportunity would be created by deregulation and reduction of wasteful government spending
@charliekirk11 And we will run out of oil &amp; gas down the road, so why run this CO2 experiment to extreme levels when need to solve sustainable energy anyway?
@charliekirk11 To be clear, I do think global warming is real and we should be concerned about the accelerating CO2 ppm growth, however the progress of sustainable energy production and consumption is tracking to solve global warming in time if we are not complacent. 

The point I was making is https://t.co/VEB74HH6Ie
It has become so obvious
@SpaceX CNBC sucks
@Lauren_Southern Anyone who thinks the media is real is an idiot
@RichardHanania Yeah
It will blow up even more tomorrow
Happy to host Kamala on an 𝕏 Spaces too
This is the long version. Shorter edit of highlights coming soon.
@alx That would 🔥🔥
Yeah
Almost all of legacy media will trash the Trump conversation, thus driving total listeners probably past 200+ million 😂
Anyone have a &lt;1 hour edit of the highlights of the @realDonaldTrump conversation?

That’s what most people will be looking for tomorrow.
@Chesschick01 The government is the one increasing the money supply!
@BillAckman Yeah
@teslaownersSV Yeah
@vkhosla Thanks 🙏
@Devon_Eriksen_ Good rebranding suggestion!
We will proceed with the smaller number of concurrent listeners at 8:30 ET and then post the unedited audio immediately thereafter
@markpinc Yeah
We tested the system with 8 million concurrent listeners earlier today
There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on 𝕏. Working on shutting it down. 

Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.
Conversation with @realDonaldTrump starts in a few minutes
My use of the word conversation is deliberate.

This is so that people understand how @realDonaldTrump talks when it’s a conversation, rather than an interview. 

Nobody is quite themselves in an interview, so it’s hard to understand what they’re really like.
@amuse The relentless lawfare to undermine the people’s right to vote for their candidate of choice has to stop!
@BasedBeffJezos Indeed, the first thing a censorious regime does is rewrite &amp; erase history
@fermatslibrary Looks complicated as an equation, but it’s actually pretty small on a spreadsheet
Conversation with @realDonaldTrump in 45 minutes!
@MarioNawfal Exactly

Is there any study contradicting this one?

@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely. 

That’s because they weren’t allowed to own guns in the countries they came from.

How time flies
Grok 2 beta release soon https://t.co/t6e9RcXPkl

A 2 tier system that is obvious to the whole world. Shame.
@LibertyCappy This has actually happened
@DimaZeniuk So many Super Heavy Boosters

@ajtourville After sleeping on it, my conclusion is that the United States is indeed lost if there is another four years of open borders, failure to prosecute crime, lawfare and increased censorship. 

It’s not even about the candidate. Kamala is obviously just a docile puppet of the system.

The rise in prices (inflation) is caused by government overspending, which increases the amount of money faster than the increase in goods &amp; services output.

That is the vast majority of the problem. 

Inflation was particularly bad during the Covid years, as there was massive
@floridanow1 @EndWokeness He is super, super racist. Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people. 

This is obvious, because he has never complained about the race of any other country’s leadership.

Why aren’t all communities protected in Britain? @Keir_Starmer
@stevenmarkryan It’s a great truck. 

We need to make it more affordable in the years to come.
The same legacy media dingbats who lied repeatedly, claiming “X/Twitter is dying”, are now saying it’s the “largest &amp; most influential platform” 🤣🤣🤣

The real crime here is that my sides hurt from laughing at the irony!

Listen Ed, if you want to refute something, it is easy
Arrested for making comments on Facebook!

Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?

Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
@LeoKearse Good grief 🤦‍♂️
This platform provides a clear and immediate way to refute anything false in the replies and with @CommunityNotes. 

The same is not true for legacy media who lie relentlessly, but there is no way to counter their propaganda.
@Klaus_Arminius Does defy logic
@farzyness I just canned this program. Was not approved.
@stillgray He doesn’t like competing with the truth. 

We’ll add him to the lawsuit.
Big difference
@Klaus_Arminius Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
@WholeMarsBlog FSD will be much safer than humans
@GadSaad Thanks Gad!
@paulg I hear the same
Cybertruck review
@mazemoore Is this real!? 🤣🤣
@anammostarac Dang that’s a burn
@markpinc Sounds pretty bad. 

@CommunityNotes, is this real?
@WallStreetSilv No choice. It is impossible to operate in San Francisco if you’re processing payments. 

That’s why Stripe, Block (CashApp) &amp; others had to move.
@ID_AA_Carmack You’re welcome!
@StephenM That’s a crazy thing for him to say
@Keir_Starmer Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?
@WallStreetSilv Does seem one-sided
@elon_docs Yeah
@WallStreetSilv There do appear to be perhaps a few philosophical differences 🤷‍♂️
@alx @adinross Cool
@MorningBrew He basically is the Fed
@rookisaacman Soon to the Moon and then Mars!
@DavidSHolz Good point
@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Cool
@WholeMarsBlog You might be right about that
@KettlebellDan Yeah
@BrianRoemmele Still a crazy number of cables in compute clusters
@visegrad24 Rather one-sided
@NWSTwinCities This should not be happening. Will investigate.

@yusufdikec I do look forward to visiting Istanbul. It is one of the great cities of the world.
@Rob_2628 Druid still feeble (sigh)

@iam_smx All 5 boys super happy
@TrungTPhan He is clearly expecting a correction of some kind or otherwise simply cannot see better investments than Treasury bills. 

The Fed needs to drop rates. They have been foolish not to have done so already.

@paulg Yeah. The team put in a staggering amount of work to get to Raptor 3.
@alifarhat79 Seriously
Model 3 Performance version is 🔥🔥
@WholeMarsBlog Other companies dumping EVs at massive negative gross margin is a problem, but not one that will last
@ajtourville Exactly
@farzyness @TeslaLarry @HansCNelson That guy doesn’t get it. I would prefer to have zero involvement in politics. 

HOWEVER 

There is no “company success” unless civilization itself continues to progress. 

This insane shift by the “left” away from a meritocracy and personal liberties (eg censorship of free speech
@ajtourville Yeah
Just did a walkthrough of the Tesla supercompute cluster at Giga Texas (aka Cortex).

This will be ~100k H100/H200 with massive storage for video training of FSD &amp; Optimus. 

Great work by the Tesla team!
@FutureJurvetson @SpaceX Indeed. It is not widely understood that SpaceX has the most advanced 3D metal printing technology in the world.
@SpaceX In a few years, we will finally have a Raptor 3/4 vacuum version (giant nozzle) that has an Isp of 380
Worth it
@SpaceX Important to note that the induced mass (mass required by a given engine design that is not the engine itself) of Raptor 3, while far better than Raptor 2, still has a lot of room for improvement.

Thrust will exceed 300 tons with Raptor 3.x (thrust/mass&gt;200), enabling 10,000
@myhiddenvalue Is this for real? @CommunityNotes
@SmallPettingZoo @Rob_2628 Same (groan)

Starlink now available in 102 countries!
@ajtourville The fundamental architecture is now right, but we will still make thousands of improvements
@ajtourville Many of them are 3D metal printed into the wall of the part
Interesting
@Erdayastronaut And it no longer requires a heat shield. Everything is regeneratively cooled.
@Erdayastronaut It really is
The amount of work required to simplify the Raptor engine, internalize secondary flow paths and add regenerative cooling for exposed components was staggering. 

As a result Raptor 3 doesn’t require any heat shield, eliminating heat shield mass &amp; complexity, as well as the fire
@hoovlet Detailed explanation
@tsarnick Yeah
@TeslaBoomerMama @Tesla @EVjectOfficial @xTakeOver Will investigate
@JamesEsses Exactly
@growing_daniel I did all my coding with just Diet Coke, burgers &amp; pizza
@SawyerMerritt It is a major breakthrough
@SawyerMerritt This really is a great product. 

Took 3 major iterations, as usual to get to something great.
@stillgray Weird
@megynkelly The sponsors are to blame
@MattWalshBlog The sponsors almost certainly forced her to do it

@GadSaad Maduro is a big guy himself and probably knows how to fight, so this would be a real fight. 

Zuck is a little fella, so that would be a short fight lol.
@MarioNawfal If I win, he resigns as dictator of Venezuela.

If he wins, I give him a free ride to Mars.

@stillgray Indeed
@SeibtNaomi For what reasons is he defined as a terrorist? 

Has he committed a violent crime or expressed clear intent to commit a violent crime?
@WallStreetSilv Maduro is not a good guy. Venezuela deserves much better. 

The US has plenty of domestic oil &amp; gas production and nothing would happen fast in Venezuela, so it would certainly not affect this election. 

Several years would be needed to rebuild Venezuela’s oil production.

@visegrad24 That is the key question
@PeterDiamandis https://t.co/2WVsoj19ET, a dating site for AI’s who are single singularities

They should mix up the propaganda more. This is way too obvious. 

Just like when they were parroting before the debate that Biden was “sharp as a tack” 🤣

@Austen Rust ftw
@ajtourville @Starlink Yeah, it’s insane
@DBurkland @farzyness Roadster
@farzyness It takes considerable software effort to optimize the code enough to run on HW3. It also needs to be validated separately. 

Estimated rollout is about 10 days.
Starlink could do it literally infinitely cheaper
@goddeketal Are you sure it was so many times? That’s a crazy number.
FSD 12.5.1 starts wide release today. 

Please connect your Tesla to WiFi to receive the update.

@MarioNawfal The lasers were great
Judge Dredd would drive a Cybertruck
@alx Trump demonstrated courage under fire
@LeadingReport What sources?
@alex_avoigt Always important to watch the whole video. Trump is asking low propensity voters to go out and vote. 

Then he hopes to, but probably won’t succeed in, implementing voter ID laws nationwide. 

That would reduce, in his opinion, the amount of voter fraud to the point where low

For regular users, ~V12.5.3 is probably suitable for wide release.
@cb_doge Yeah
@alx This happens every time he does rails
@AdrianDittmann The moment is the only thing that exists
@DavidSHolz With the right DNA mods, we could literally turn into butterflies
Starlink now operating on over 1000 aircraft! 

Using Starlink on a plane feels like you’re on a high speed ground fiber connection.
@StephenKing It hurts our feelings when you deadname 😢
@AOC The Democratic Party has become openly &amp; boldly antisemitic
@migbits Coming soon to iOS &amp; Android!
@jack Cool
@dvorahfr @Magnific_AI @LumaLabsAI Impressive
@ZubyMusic Yeah
@AbigailShrier How many times did Kamala, who was appointed “Border Czar” by Biden, actually visit the border that she’s czar of?
@DavidSacks Not necessarily. Kamala is just a puppet, so they could tell her at the last minute. She’ll read whatever the teleprompter says.
@chrismanfrank @Cernovich Interesting
@BasedBeffJezos Yeah, so many things are weirdly the opposite of their name
@stillgray Yeah. 

It’s tricky, as I have a threat profile higher than many heads of state, but am put into the “corporate CEO” bucket for major events. 

Means I have to stay relatively secluded.
@yacineMTB Yeah, it is a major pain train
Cool
@yacineMTB I think the same thing about myself tbh
@Holden_Culotta Just another corpo puppet
Shouldn’t the nominee be decided by a party vote? Democracy etc … https://t.co/EH0aYvSG1m
About 3 weeks ago, the media told you that Biden was “sharp as a tack” 🙄 

2 days ago, the poor guy was basically forced at gunpoint to resign as Dem nominee. His staff weren’t even informed.

Now they say Kamala is the best thing ever 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/E58MlrQZqI
@MikeBenzCyber They are jumping the gun
@cb_doge Yeah
@stillgray Yeah, it’s ridiculous. 

I am making some donations to America PAC, but at a much lower level and the key values of the PAC are supporting a meritocracy &amp; individual freedom. 

Republicans are mostly, but not entirely, on the side of merit &amp; freedom.
@Noahpinion This is beyond dumb. 

I never said was donating $45M/month to Trump – that was a totally fake @WSJ article! 

How can back down from something that never happened!!??
@Gfilche @Tesla @xai Interesting
@cb_doge I wouldn’t trust WhatsApp at all
Should Tesla invest $5B into @xAI, assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors?

(Board approval &amp; shareholder vote are needed, so this is just to test the waters)
@Gfilche @xai Well, we would need a shareholder vote for that. 

Will hold a poll, see what people think and then discuss with the board.
@Lisahudsonchow7 Pretty much
@MattWalshBlog Release in theaters if you want basically no one to see it

Starlink is now active in a Gaza hospital with the support of @UAEmediaoffice and @Israel
@SawyerMerritt Waymo money 😂
@MartinViecha @travisraxelrod Good work by Travis &amp; team
@MarioNawfal Cool!
@bgurley @finkd +1 for Zuck
@tsarnick Sure is
@ajtourville And Dojo 1 will have roughly 8k H100-equivalent of training online by end of year.

Not massive, but not trivial either.
Tesla quarterly update
@nearcyan Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space
@ajtourville Important to note that we also use the Tesla HW4 AI computer in the training loop with Nvidia GPUs, currently at roughly a 1:2 ratio. Also, we’re changing the name from Hardware 4 (HW4) to Artificial Intelligence 4 (AI4). 

That means ~90k H100, plus ~40k AI4 computers.
@karpathy @AIatMeta It is impressive and Zuck does deserve credit for open-sourcing
@ajtourville What those parameters effectively do is compress reality
@markpinc @VP Kamala will be significantly further left than Biden
@alexisohanian Best 3 words of advice I’ve heard in a while
@ID_AA_Carmack This would be super effective for me! 😂
@alex_avoigt It’s easy to increase params. Making them high SNR is hard.
@SpeakerJohnson Good
@stclairashley Good idea
@dinkin_flickaa Great
@MarioNawfal For sure
@robbystarbuck @harleydavidson Harley Davidson?
@WholeMarsBlog We are focusing on just Model Y with HW4 for the initial release. Make sure that works well, then broaden. 

This has the 5X increase in parameters. 

HW3 would run the same parameter count, but requires extra work to optimize the code.
@BillMelugin_ High time
@eldsjal Congrats!
@Rothmus Speedy is a great character (and always wins)
@niccruzpatane Yeah
@niccruzpatane I agree.

@KettlebellDan 😂

But seriously where is he?
Might be one day
@BehizyTweets @yehuda_miller I’m not sure how to help.
@againstgrmrs Xavier was born gay and slightly autistic , two attributes that contribute to gender dysphoria.  

I knew that from when he was about 4 years old and he would pick out clothes for me to wear like a jacket and tell me it was “fabulous!”, as well as his love of musicals &amp; theatre.

@ZubyMusic It is safe to say that not everyone in the government is super hard-working and brilliantly competent
This is a significant advantage in training the world’s most powerful AI by every metric by December this year

@i_dg23 Tesla will have genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year and, hopefully, high production for other companies in 2026
Nice work by @xAI team, @X team, @Nvidia &amp; supporting companies getting Memphis Supercluster training started at ~4:20am local time.

@reidhoffman Trump/Vance LFG!!
@reedhastings Trump/Vance LFG!!
@netcapgirl Ride the information dragon!
@levie Trump/Vance LFG!!
Leaders should post directly, not hand the role to intermediaries. That is what works best. 

Mistakes will be made, but that’s what proves it’s real. People want authenticity.
𝕏 is a meme goldmine rn
White House aides learned Biden was dropping out by reading 𝕏
@BillMelugin_ It’s almost like they knew it was coming
@Jason @AlexanderSoros Yeah, tell us Alex 😂😂
@Jason They just want a puppet that will perform better. The political machine will remain in power. 

What’s different about Trump is that he isn’t a puppet of either side, so real government reform is possible.
@The_Kyle_Mann When was he ever running America?
They are so slow
@WallStreetSilv Not that I’ve heard
@vkhosla He doesn’t hate you. In fact, I think he likes you. Meet him and find out for yourself. 

How many times have you read something in the media where you know the real story, but what they printed was diabolically false? Well, it’s way worse in politics, which is a blood sport.

@vkhosla @realDonaldTrump @GovWhitmer @GovernorShapiro Come on, Vinod. Trump/Vance LFG!!
@MarioNawfal Amazing, since half of DC knew this would happen last week
@DavidSacks *Jill
@stclairashley Yeah, all his predictions have come true
I believe in an America that maximizes individual freedom and merit. 

That used to be the Democratic Party, but now the pendulum has swung to the Republican Party.
My smartest friends, including those living in the San Francisco Bay Area who have been lifelong Dems, are excited about Trump/Vance
@KanekoaTheGreat I heard last week that he would resign at this exact time and date. It was widespread knowledge in DC. 

The real powers that be are discarding the old puppet in favor of one that has a better chance of fooling the public.

They fear Trump because he is not a puppet.
Exactly
@stevenmarkryan Yeah
@WallStreetSilv Director Cheetos is criminally incompetent.

A good man is dead due to this anti-meritocratic culture!
@MarioNawfal Weird
@WallStreetSilv It’s not a contest. Humans should not be on drone battlefields.
@EndWokeness So tolerant and kind
@KanekoaTheGreat No machines at all
@HazelAppleyard_ Damn 😂
Whoa
@elon_docs Thanks @ReedHastings!
@LibertyCappy Such a weird shift of the left to bow down to authority
@MattWalshBlog I don’t agree with you, but there should certainly be extremely thorough vetting of anyone using surrogates
@GailAlfarATX Happens so often
@stclairashley Every time the game said that, I thought “war does change!”
@MikeBenzCyber Even adjusted for inflation! Dang.
@SpeakerJohnson Absolutely. The failure to have a meritocracy is why an innocent person is now dead!
@fentasyl Journalists, for the most part, are the insufferable smug snitches from middle school who turned pro. Think about that.
@paulg Yeah
Change the programs that someone else put in your mind
@BasedMikeLee Absolutely. In-person only and paper ballots. Same-day counting.
@elon_docs Yeah!
@zebulgar We should create a permanently occupied moonbase
@FischerKing64 I literally have zero interests Russia. Tesla has no operations there, SpaceX directly competes with Russia for space launch and Starlink is a key asset of Ukraine.

Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas.

So an untrained kid can handle that simple roof no problem, but professional snipers can’t?

And … just find a sloped roof somewhere if you want to assassinate Presidential candidates!?
@paulg Exactly
@MarioNawfal Damn, they must be next-level spicy!
@DavidSacks Well done
@PeterSweden7 Yay, I hope so!
This would be great
@LibertyCappy Pretty much

@cb_doge I was pulling network cables on Saturday to understand the critical path better.

Went through both the Tesla and xAI supercomputer clusters.

@MikeBenzCyber Super weird
WSJ management needs to clean house over there. 

If there is any news organization on Earth that should be unabashedly pro capitalism, it is the WALL STREET Journal, for goodness sake!

It’s literally in the name lmao.

@robbystarbuck Either way, many should be fired.

Extreme incompetence is indistinguishable from sabotage/conspiracy, but that they failed badly in their job is unquestionably true, therefore they need to go.

@Cernovich You’re right
@Cernovich So before being in charge of protecting the President, she was guarding bags of Cheetos …
Extreme incompetence or it was deliberate. Either way, the SS leadership must resign.
@JackPosobiec He ought to be in jail
@LibertyLockPod That would be next-level
@WallStreetSilv Lack of manpower does not explain it. Bystanders tried to point out the sniper to security (in a very obvious location) for minutes before the shooting

@Liv_Boeree Blue checks were being bought and sold openly. 

One didn’t even need to go to the “dark web”, you could just Google “blue check for sale”!

@BillboardChris This is insane
@SpaceX We’re updating satellite software to run the ion thrusters at their equivalent of warp 9. 

Unlike a Star Trek episode, this will probably not work, but it’s worth a shot.

The satellite thrusters need to raise orbit faster than atmospheric drag pulls them down or they burn up.
@SERobinsonJr Upper stage restart to raise perigee resulted in an engine RUD for reasons currently unknown. Team is reviewing data tonight to understand root cause.

Starlink satellites were deployed, but the perigee may be too low for them to raise orbit. Will know more in a few hours.

@RichardHanania Best to hear it in the words I have used in many interviews over the years. 

I have not fwiw “volunteered my sperm” 😂

No one at SpaceX has been directed to work on a Mars city. When people have asked to do so, I’ve said we need to focus on getting there first.
Having seen the evidence unearthed today by Congress, 𝕏 has no choice but to file suit against the perpetrators and collaborators in the advertising boycott racket. 

Hopefully, some states will consider criminal prosecution.
@cb_doge Amazingly versatile!
@diana_dukic Nikola Tesla was great and AC was the right move back then.

Confusing resource/capital allocation with consumption is a common axiomatic error.

@xDaily xAI contracted for 24k H100s from Oracle and Grok 2 trained on those. Grok 2 is going through finetuning and bug fixes. Probably ready to release next month.

Electronic voting machines and anything mailed in is too risky. 

We should mandate paper ballots and in-person voting only. https://t.co/TVC32b1Wkd
@SmokeAwayyy @spacejanitorX Noted
@stillgray @TheOfficial1984 There should be no “special categories”. A clear call to violence against anyone is not ok.
@stillgray Seriously
@libsoftiktok Great question. The media all turned in unison like a marching band. So weird!
This is an excellent way to assess someone’s rationality.

Another way is to ask them to assign a probability to their argument being true vs false. Anyone who says anywhere close to 100% for a matter where there is subjectivity is full of 💩.
@TheOfficial1984 Gage made repeated and clear calls for violence, which is illegal, hence 6 month suspension. 

Rule applies to everyone, apart from the “UN exemption” for recognized leaders of countries. If politicians can say something to the UN General Assembly, then they can say it here.
@tsarnick Not wrong
@fentasyl Whoa, that trend line is almost vertical!
@MikeBenzCyber DMVs operate at the state level, but still this does seem to be an issue

@Klaus_Arminius What the heck is going on in Germany?

This is not right.
@TurkeyBeaver Looks familiar
When combined with mail-in ballots, the system is *designed* to make it impossible to prove fraud.

Mail-in and drop box ballots should not be allowed, as cameras on the in-person voting stations would at least prevent large-scale fraud by counting how many people showed up vs

Once Tesla fully solves autonomy and has Optimus in volume production, anyone still holding a short position will be obliterated. Even Gates.

That almost the entire media repeated the same lie with the exact same words is disturbing.

@WallStreetSilv What?
@cb_doge Utterly false. All Community Notes code *and* data is open source, so you can confirm independently whether any community note will be shown.

@JTLonsdale Absolutely!
@FrankLuntz Frank, you’re an idiot
@AdrianDittmann Yeah
@RichardHanania True. 

All things considered, it would be better to legalize, regulate and tax drugs, just as we do with alcohol and cigarettes, both of which are drugs that cause millions of deaths every year worldwide.
@ScYolo_2022 @visegrad24 Correct
@EndWokeness Who killed them?
@06Kiu @WallStreetSilv Clearly
@awoooouwuooooo @Scobleizer I’ve wanted to do that for a long time :)

Our real-world simulation and video generation is the best in the world, but unfortunately making a game can only come after we release unsupervised FSD that is far safer than even supervised FSD.
@Scobleizer Where Tesla video generation exceeds OpenAI is that it predicts extremely accurate physics. That is essential for self-driving.
Exactly
@MatthewDR @OpenAI It isn’t clear to me how the OpenAI structure is legal at all. 

I was offered shares a various points, but it seemed unethical/illegal to accept them.
The original reason for creating @OpenAI

@Kristennetten Stephen 👑 

His posts are 🔥🔥
@WallStreetSilv Almost every illegal is a Dem voter. Therefore, the Dem Party will not take action until they lose more votes due to ushering in vast numbers of illegals than they gain.

They are counting on complacency from Dem and independent voters, which, at least so far, has worked.

Simple
@DavidSacks Accurate
@DrKnowItAll16 @OpenAI @Tesla We have been short on training compute for FSD, so haven’t trained with other video, but certainly could. Will do it later this year when we have some spare capacity.
@DrKnowItAll16 @OpenAI @Tesla Tesla has been able to do real-world video generation with accurate physics for about a year. 

It wasn’t super interesting, because all the training data came from the cars, so it just looks like video from a Tesla, albeit with a dynamically generated (not remembered) world.

@EdKrassen Absolutely! Kids are the best. 

I’m doing my best to encourage more people to become parents and ideally have three or more kids, so humanity can grow. 

The population collapse in most countries is a tragedy.

Sales of adult diapers should never exceed sales of baby diapers!
The public still doesn’t understand even a tiny fraction of the power of the censorship government-industrial complex.

As predicted, my companies and I came under relentless attack the moment the censorship of this platform was lifted.

How far will they go to stop me?
@ZubyMusic To be fair, there are also many men who favor hedonistic sex over becoming a father, then wondering why it feels so empty

@shaunmmaguire Yeah
What matters most about Powerwall 3 is that it can handle peak power of ~30kW,  which is enough to handle dryers &amp; air-conditioners. 

This means that a single Powerwall is now enough for most homes.

That’s the Overton Window opening.

@stclairashley @alx Makes total sense that Mayorkas was on the board of an organization that has the explicit goal of facilitating illegal immigration, given that he is now continuing that mission as Homeland Secretary
@TimSweeneyEpic What’s up with this?

NGO personnel who deliberately and repeatedly broke the law to facilitate illegal immigration should face prosecution immediately!

@lsferguson Many states automatically register anyone with a driver’s license to vote (no citizenship verification), ballots are then mailed out and “ballot harvesters” pick them up mail them in, making fraud traceability impossible
@EndWokeness Major scam
@SpeakerJohnson Absolutely
@fentasyl Exactly
Well-summarized
@stclairashley Exactly, this is a massive monetary incentive to *increase* the flow of illegals!
The long-term goal of the so-called “Border Security” bill is enabling illegals to vote!

It will do the total opposite of securing the border.
Thank you
Good progress!
@teslaownersSV First, no one has ever mentioned rehab to me ever. 

Second, if they are saying that I was able to lead Tesla to be by far the most valuable carmaker and SpaceX to be by far the most valuable space company *simultaneously*, that is the greatest compliment I have ever received!
@RadioGenoa Sources?
@krassenstein Agreed
@ScottAdamsSays Recommend that they also read X. Worst case, they will have a better understanding of the so-called “hoaxes”. 

They don’t need to stop reading NY Times, but they probably will once they realize they’ve been had.

A few other things you probably don’t know: illegals in America can get bank loans, mortgages, insurance, driver’s licenses, free healthcare (California &amp; New York) and in-state college tuition.

What’s the point of being a citizen if an illegal gets all the benefits, but doesn’t
@JackPosobiec Yeah

@kerrikgray @SecMayorkas Of course, but he very much believes in massive illegal immigration himself
@alx @SecMayorkas Wow, what a staggeringly idiotic and immense liar!

There is so much fire coming from his pants, I’m surprised the building didn’t burn down!
@alex_avoigt That part is not awesome, but it doesn’t matter. Electric vehicles are inevitable.
@realCarola2Hope @SecMayorkas For massively amplifying the problem, not merely being incompetent
@EndWokeness @SecMayorkas I agree
@BillyM2k They are importing as many voters as possible before the elections
@CollinRugg What a tangled web!
Impeach @SecMayorkas for deliberately breaking the law and massively increasing illegal immigration beyond all historical precedent
In the “bet-you-didn’t-know” category,
Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas issued written guidance making it clear that:

1. Illegal presence alone is not grounds for deportation.

2. Criminal charges, convictions or gang membership alone are not enough for deportation.

You
@stclairashley That’s their actual name?
As a reminder, I am very much PRO increasing legal immigration significantly. 

I’m not anti-immigration, I’m just against a massive number of unvetted people flooding into America, which any rational person should be.

We should not, for example, impose draconian laws on farmers or make citizens uncomfortable by limiting air-conditioner usage!

Keep tax revenue constant, but shift it to  tax what is probably bad (CO2), just like alcohol &amp; cigarettes are taxed more than fruits &amp; vegetables.
The only action needed to solve climate change is is a carbon tax
@FlyinBuddha @disclosetv It should be
@KimDotcom Feels that way
@zerohedge Very much so
@VivekGRamaswamy Exactly
@Not_the_Bee Anyone can claim asylum with no proof. It is the magic word that gets anyone, even hardened criminals, into America.
@cb_doge Yeah
Most people in America don’t know that the census is based on a simple headcount of people (including illegals) *not* just citizens.  

This shifts political power and money to states and Congressional districts with the highest number of illegals.
@nypost Makes no sense
@TechBroDrip @WholeMarsBlog Now he can crack walnuts with his fists
@fentasyl Krugman is a candidate for most wrong economist who is still alive
@eyeslasho Yeah, I don’t know anyone who uses Facebook
@CollinRugg What is even the point of arresting criminals if nothing is done!? No prison, no deportation.
@therealZNO I was embarrassingly slow to figure it out
@CollinRugg He’s right
@AdamLowisz @krassenstein Exactly
This explains why there are so few deportations, as every deportation is a lost vote.

As happened this week, you can literally assault police officers in broad daylight in New York, be released with no bail, give everyone the finger and *still* not be deported!!

Outrageous.
@jasondebolt I believe this is referred to as “ballot harvesting”. 

They just send people to pick up the ballots, as in-person voting and proof of citizenship is not required.
@Marslamute Due to opposition by Senators Manchin and Sinema, it did not. 

However, Manchin retires this year and Sinema has been ousted from the Democratic Party, so neither will be there to stop this next year.
Here is the full text of the bill. It sounds so reasonable at first, just like “The Committee of Public Safety” actually meant “The Cutting Off Heads Committee” in revolutionary France.
https://t.co/DCMTHHEIjM
Biden’s strategy is very simple:

1. Get as many illegals in the country as possible.

2. Legalize them to create a permanent majority – a one-party state.

That is why they are encouraging so much illegal immigration. Simple, yet effective. https://t.co/B9M5ypUOQB

@alx That was certainly what they actually did, but it is challenging getting things approved politically with an honest title

The foundation of war is economics, specifically industrial capacity, and the Allies were far stronger in this regard.

@alex_avoigt She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history

The illegal influx is growing exponentially and just exceeded babies born in America last month!
@stclairashley @EdKrassen @RareImagery @krassenstein Exactly. 

And even if economics is not what they tell officials, it is obviously the reason for coming to America.

Especially when states like California make medical care free for illegals. No amount of money can increase the number of doctors as fast as people can move here,
@EdKrassen @RareImagery Here comes the actual hard part: what is the solution?

Court dates are 5 to 7 years away and growing to infinity.
@thejefflutz @Tesla Thanks!
@TesLatino Sorry it took so long
@alx And deport more than zero illegals. That would help too.
@alx Change the asylum rule that allows anyone to claim asylum with no proof and that classifies “economic reasons” as sufficient, as that means basically 80% of Earth

Border Patrol is being instructed to facilitate illegal entry at scale into the United States.

The fundamental problem is that anyone can claim asylum with zero proof, which means all of Earth can come
@POTUS No laws need to be passed. All that is needed is an executive order to require proof before granting an asylum hearing. That is how it used to be.

@GadSaad I read your insightful book on the parasitic woke mind virus. It gave me nightmares 😬.
@GadSaad Saad, but very true
@SawyerMerritt Yeah, I was running on very little sleep for several days due to extreme work requirements. Worth noting that Tesla was very close to bankruptcy in 2017.
@SokobanHero @WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@SpaceX Pretty much everything I predicted in that talk has happened or is in process of happening
@WholeMarsBlog Yup, that’s the one 😂
@alx So cringe

This explains Mark Cuban’s ridiculous overcompensation regarding racism.

Same thing happened with #MeToo guys who got bust suddenly becoming fake ardent feminists.

@Meyers85014 @NameRedacted247 @mcuban Exactly
@Timcast Just guessing or you have some inside scoop?

Whoa, I did not know this
@dani_elle831 @teslaownersSV If elections are open for 16 hours, essentially everyone can vote
@teslaownersSV We should require government ID and in-person voting (unless valid medical/ military/etc excuse), like other countries do or like if you want to buy beer
@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah, that was weird. Literally the same people who said voter ID was racist also demanded that you get a vaccine ID to travel anywhere or work!
@krassenstein How does this story end? That’s the question.
@EvasTeslaSPlaid @Tesla Does kinda have cylon vibes
@EdKrassen It is the hypocrisy that bothers me. 

Obviously, women’s (or men’s) sports, for example, are sexist by definition. 

What is absurd and hypocritical is to claim that something isn’t racist/sexist when it obviously is!
@jgebbia I guess glass is the way to go?
@isabelleboemeke Even aluminum cans have plastic liners. The toxicity of plastic is up for debate, but I definitely don’t like the idea of eating plastic!

Claiming that people can’t figure out how to get ID is racist and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms

In the USA, you don’t need government issued ID to vote and you can mail in your ballot. This is insane.

@askracher @0xAlaric The impact of rifles in the Napoleonic wars is sometimes dismissed, because so few rifles were produced relative to ball muskets, but this misses the point.

@inventions4uu @0xAlaric 😂

Just don’t invade Russia. It’s never a good idea.

While it is trivial to enter the United States illegally, it is insanely difficult for legal immigrants to move to the United States. 

This is madness! We should shut down illegal immigration and greatly increase legal immigration.

@DrKnowItAll16 They view them as future Dem voters
At this point, there is no question that this administration is actively facilitating illegal immigration. 

The numbers speak for themselves.

@GavinSBaker Yeah
@geertwilderspvv Agreed, but even countries that have very few immigrants, like Korea and Japan, are experiencing population collapse. 

If the birth rate stays as low as it is, the Dutch nation will die out by its own hand.

@DavidNagySFgang @rocketry_catboy Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. 

Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity &amp; so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure. 

Potential future optimization.

@motorsep Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico.
Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey.
Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China https://t.co/ZzN9Tabq8C
@martinmeany We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:

And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M
Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
⛄️ 🎄 🎁 🎅 💝 😀
@AndrewSamoylich @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ...
@lexfridman @Tesla @karpathy Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent.
@cleantechnica Sigh
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side
@vicentes @Tesla Glad you’re ok!
@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Starship will look like liquid silver
@elliemecham @whatsinside Haha 🤣
@Kristennetten @rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Maybe
@rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Much less
@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
@StevenHardison Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better
Stainless Steel Starship https://t.co/rRoiEKKrYc
@nextPlanetOver @WorldAndScience Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
@WorldAndScience Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
Engineering is true magic
@LeilaniMunter @Tesla @HickoryPD @StephenAtHome @cleanairNC @cleanenergyorg @CMPD How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
@nichegamer Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities …
Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions.
@BENBALLER Thanks!
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.
@NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
@Erdayastronaut @ludan27 @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem.
@_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀
@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
@John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Coldformed at cryo
@Malcolmmarsman @TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly
@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
@wangmeister It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end
@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi
Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr or visit stores.
@quantumVerd @QuilletteM @pewdiepie Only if Dawkins joins
@QuilletteM Interesting
Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector
@chrinder Haha
@Taraustralis Needs a warmup
@Space_Station @AstroAnnimal @Astro_DavidS Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every 90 minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
@JohnKasich Thanks, will consider next year
@nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won’t matter for the first few layers
Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a 💨 after them haha https://t.co/5GCgM4RT4W
Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: https://t.co/LS4EhN57Mw
Join our underground movement!
@DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? https://t.co/vxcZ2Hi2qx
@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly
@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear.
@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better.
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla
Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again https://t.co/3a6i0NoSmi
Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight https://t.co/bwRt49d34V
@kirstenkorosec @TechCrunch @boringcompany Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
@Model3Owners Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
@TweetReinhard @TechCrunch Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
@oc_isly @TechCrunch Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!
Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
@realrobcopeland @SpaceX Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”
@cleantechnica Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting
Tesla 💨 app almost done. Important to get every note right!
@richardbranson @virgingalactic @TheSpaceshipCo Thanks!
@jallen0472 @vincent13031925 @Tesla The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
@richardbranson @virgingalactic @TheSpaceshipCo Congratulations!
@ErikVlugt @annerajb You got it
@annerajb Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
@jeffects01 God Fire
💕🍜 ramen is sooo good🍜 💕
@EricIdle Exactly 😀
@businessinsider This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound. https://t.co/VxO9rR1uAf
@John_Papa @Tesla You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
@Malcolmmarsman Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
@business Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”.
@annerajb About 10 to 14 days
Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)
Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. 

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year.
@erikstorli No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
@lgebman I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. 

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be.
@vincent13031925 @teslectrics @60Minutes @MKBHD Probably next month
@teslectrics @60Minutes You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
@javagiri @Tesla We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.
@fluffypony @Tesla Probably end of next year
@DOfaquarius @ElonsBrain @LiveBit_io @60Minutes So true 🦙💩✨😴
@60Minutes This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
@MesQueUnBanjo We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
@ghhaugen Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability.
Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.
@danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. https://t.co/NxCgYO9JXx
@nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.
@brandonorselli Buying https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like https://t.co/BsRfMrY9Gm even when we were only making 🚘.
Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
@cleantechnica Interesting
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal
@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon. https://t.co/O3h8eCgGJ7
@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.
Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes
@mattbeckman Us too sigh
Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim.
64 satellites 🛰 on this flight!
@Jennerator211 @PPathole @JohnnaCrider1 We’re adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
@JohnnaCrider1 Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.
@LittleMissFlint It is so hard to move in armor!
@boringcompany You’re all hired!
@LittleMissFlint Yes … no … maybe …
None shall pass!
@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice
@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you’re ok
@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.
@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.
@johnkrausphotos Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon
@MatZagataMD @Tesla You got it!
@dxk_ @ZainRaz4 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Three things, one of which is CH4
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off.
@nichegamer Haha
@pfierens @LikeTeslaKim Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience.
@LikeTeslaKim Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC.
@Manic_Marge @SpaceX True ♥️

@highspeeddoc @boringcompany We’re doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead.
@teslaownersSV Update soon
@NatGeo Sorry ☺️
Boring breakthrough @BoringCompany https://t.co/pSflhZadwC
@megnsander Definitely
After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car
@rocketisfine @racchava @gwestr We tried. Nintendo won’t license it to us.
@racchava @gwestr That would be cool
@ArnaoutShady Never heard of it
Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games.
@prades_maxime Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
@NBCNews This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.
You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent.
Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.
@Shell Tiny wizard 🧙‍♂️
@YoBigBrotha @anandmahindra 7 to 10 years
@anandmahindra Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build.
But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work
@margrethmpossi Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.
There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week
Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then @SpaceX, @Tesla, @BoringCompany &amp; @Neuralink are the places to be.
@NASA @NASAInSight Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
@forummp3 1000 liters of pure water costs $1
For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon
@PLAYERUNKNOWN Ah yes fair point
Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley
@Zedd Not yet
🖤 trouble
Earth is
@WorldAndScience Earth’s crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava https://t.co/Lm6doeOq2x
@WorldAndScience Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land.
@jessedh @Tesla Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting
@Malcolmmarsman Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield
If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America https://t.co/phhBjCh2YI via @cleantechnica

🚀 Starships were meant to fly 🚀
https://t.co/6yclRVZZFQ
@bevvscott Starship Tooters
@Orangejamal @speceye @Tesla Good one
@FredericLambert @speceye @Tesla Good idea
@speceye @Tesla Coming soon
@wiredprairie @Tesla Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
@Model3Owners Should be next week
@annerajb No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9
@mwolman98 Later versions will
Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)
Renaming BFR to Starship
@universal_sci No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR
Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
@vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019
@LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
@WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.
@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
@ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years
@stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app.
@jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers
@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
@FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive.
@FrameshiftShark Radical change
Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.
@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.
Congratulations @BoringCompany on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology! https://t.co/80WbSQekCQ

Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet.
Not much but it is ours https://t.co/gx2l84M3f7
The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent https://t.co/VChOVXXVaz
@TechDeals_16 We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains don’t leave often.
@vincent13031925 Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain
Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.
@FredericLambert We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
@victorpoughon Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location.
Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30 https://t.co/npmPuSXNWC
@InsideEVs We will fight Big Tequila!
@garos82 @nichegamer That would be awesome
@jimmyzhong_iost @SpaceX Easily accessible energy
@nichegamer Send me a note!
@nichegamer Would be fun to add to Tesla
@nextspaceflight @SpaceX @NASA Will try again next month
Congratulations @SpaceX team! Thanks @NASA, much appreciated.
@_sheateher @MalibuWine Is he ok?
It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.
@karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
@kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
@SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …
@zandywithaz Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
@JackCydia Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.
If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
@tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point, will reenable
@mihk101 Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.
Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
@exzacklyright @MKBHD @austinnotduncan @Tesla Cool
@Tesla With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster
@Tesla Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
@Erdayastronaut @annerajb No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas
@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
@annerajb Aiming for orbital flight by June

@Benioff @boringcompany LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec 10. Runs parallel to 105 freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to 405.

@samsheffer Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating
So underappreciated
Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
@_DionnaLeo @CouRageJD What is love?
@VampyBitme Fair
@TylerGlaiel Yes, that is how
We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
@nichegamer Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
@bonnienorman Wow that’s cool!
Kids these days have it easy
I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
@trobbu @Tesla Haha

@Scobleizer @Tesla They’re great! Honored to work with them.
@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Definitely
@DatHandsomeJerk @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation
@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020
@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!

Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+).
Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
@rarelyserious @Tesla For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid &amp; park.
@rarelyserious @Tesla Cool haha

@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Don’t worry, we’ll make it right
@CGasparino @Tesla The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
@Model3Owners Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
@Lindowitz @FredericLambert It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …
@CGasparino @Tesla Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?
@sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars
@rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund
@ctgm @FredericLambert Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer
@FredericLambert Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
@annerajb @FredericLambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey Exactly. That’s Monday.
@officialjaden Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm.
@pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey No, but I will
@mangeHDbackup Isn’t it obvious?
@yames51 @DigitalDunzey Worth it

Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
@sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal.
@fb1975 @DigitalDunzey Haha
@DigitalDunzey On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%.
@nichegamer @raissabontempo @SomeGrayAreas @reddit @Twitter Reddit is massive, but def has gems
@SomeGrayAreas @reddit @Twitter Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit
@Mcgillligan Exactly
@FactsDataTruth @Tesla You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great.
Glad you’re ok @tylerthecreator

@cleantechnica Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone.
Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
@mikearildbrown @MartyHungerford Same
How’d they know!? https://t.co/AZh4EOrgmc
@MartyHungerford Around mid 2019
@houmanhemmati @FredericLambert There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past.
@FredericLambert Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.
To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.
@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars

Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so
@dennishegstad It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see.
Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires.
@DannyMekic It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February

@Erdayastronaut @smeranda New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
@smeranda Yes, aiming for next few months
@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
Insightful article by David @Pogue
@ID_AA_Carmack Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day.
@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Still a long way to go
Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.

@FredericLambert No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
@wonderofscience It sure does. Very reliable.
@davidquearney You are right

@Jason @Tesla Actually, it’s 1 of 3 forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked.
@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point 😀
@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!
@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide. https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR
@Model3Owners V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
@mgerrydoyle Only if they’re extremely tiny
Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years
First Falcon 9 land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking.
@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder
@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.
@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time
@FlintSchools @MuskFoundation You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
What they do should be illegal
The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
@FCalciu @derekGUMB @Scobleizer @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.

@neveryb Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️
@ParkerWoolfolk Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range.
@ctbarker32 Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load.
@slashdot Tricky one
@DMC_Ryan Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!
@NASASpaceflight Probably 2028 for a base to be built
@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.
@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.
@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side
@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts
Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.
@Cardoso @NHTSAgov Haha true
.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
@primadanna @Tesla @alphacali Wow, glad they’re ok!
@vicentes @DanAloni @slashdot Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality

@nirbheek Sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier.
@thereal_scottv Yeah, that’s our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.
Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour.
Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy

@SyrinxStarman @TeslaRoadTrip @Tesla Thoughtful feedback
Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority.
@PauloBriski @Tesla My apologies, am working on this exact issue right now
@adultswim @RickandMorty Best show in the multiverse!
@ebf No, service will stock all colors
@DMC_Ryan @EdoubleZero Love that red. We tried every possible way to make red look 3D without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. We have to stop whole paint shop for red &amp; it looks like an episode of Dexter.
Moving 2 of 7 Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black &amp; Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price.

@andrew_gold_ Am running it in my car, but it’s not right yet. Hopefully, will release to advanced early access users in a week or two, then more broadly towards end of month.
@mliebow @Tesla Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements.
@FredericLambert @pooktd The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity
@pooktd Sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done.

@yoda @RMac18 @TijenOnaran So you actually did nothing &amp; yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is @yoda.
@yoda @RMac18 @TijenOnaran Answer the question @yoda. You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?
@McMurchie @alexmd2 @Techmeme @CatherineShu At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam
@yoda @RMac18 @TijenOnaran Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?
@alexmd2 @Techmeme @CatherineShu It’s coming, I swear
@yoda @RMac18 @TijenOnaran You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself @yoda …
@Techmeme @CatherineShu Great actions by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.
@TijenOnaran For the record, my voice cracked once during the NY Times article. That’s it. There were no tears.
@TheIanChen @Tesla Sure :)
@jwiechers @SwiftOnSecurity I want that outfit
The world lost a great man in John McCain. He was an honorable, kind, brave and fundamentally decent human being. If only there were more such people in the world.
@GrowthHackers This is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without
@SeanHQuinn @yanquetino @Tesla This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
@yanquetino @Tesla Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs.
@j_brorsson @InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …
@InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Maybe …
@AskDrStupid This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord
@Tesla In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public.
@nichegamer It’s almost done
@isco__ Yes 😀🖤🚀, looks brutal otherwise
This is actually real
This time, the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer &amp; SpaceX will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising designs. Bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of sound!
@AshleyEsqueda Tesla Car Karaoke hopefully ready in OTA software update version 10. Just played Missile Command, Asteroids &amp; Lunar Lander in V9. Really fun!
@ElectrekCo I was just there. Cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught fire. Super appreciate fast response by Fremont fire dept! No injuries or damage to factory.
Goal is to service your car wherever you are, quietly &amp; quickly. No need to bring it to a Tesla service center.
Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought.

@amitkatwala @WiredUK Open to it at some point. You did an impressive amount of work on this article.
@amitkatwala @WiredUK Mostly accurate, even though I didn’t do an interview (or pose for cover)
@Josh1C Good idea, we will add this feature!
Model 3 traction testing on pure ice &amp; snow
Great Q&amp;A @defcon last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla &amp; SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all.
@momof3terrors Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun  project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see.
@FredericLambert @woodhaus2 Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model 3 &amp; bringing Y to market

@SpaceXUpdates Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
@lexiheft @FredericLambert @lexfridman Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware
@FredericLambert @lexfridman Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.
Tesla deliveries &amp; AP hardware chart by @lexfridman at MIT https://t.co/6vZxKMcec2
@MindFieldMusic Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
@thatspacegeek Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)
@FredericLambert No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private
@heydave7 Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
@FredericLambert I don’t have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
Good morning 😀
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
@ChillinQuillen @joerogan Maybe Thursday
That’s right provided the two Crew Dragon test flights go well. Hardware will def be ready.
@gdb @OpenAI @Blitz_DotA Great work by @OpenAI. Need the neural interface soon to enable human/AI symbiosis.
@Excellion We’re working on a new Tesla mini-car that can squeeze in an adult
@Rengle820 Model S P100D is def still the top end, but Model 3 Performance is higher value for money
@lexiheft Early access will have bugs (usually minor, but you never know for sure), so would not advise early access unless you’re prepared to have something go wrong
@vicentes @vishaljotshi Everywhere …
@LanceUlanoff @vishaljotshi Much more interesting
@chriscardinal Games &amp; other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X &amp; 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3’s plus S &amp; X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher).
Glad you’re enjoying Model 3 &amp; thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with V9.0.
@MatthewTBishop @mattdebord Def worth it. Model 3 Performance is next-level.

@iLehonardo Can’t wait to bring Tesla to Brazil. One of my favorite countries!
@l9cgv We should be really worried about this
@AndredAlmeida Yeah, Model 3 is designed to fit 6’4”  adults comfortably in both front &amp; rear seats at same time
We’re adding a “party &amp; camper mode” soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music &amp; power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock …
Not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there’s room for trunks in front &amp; back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car
@Tesla Hard drive industry is hardcore. They build &gt;100 million units per year with extreme precision &amp; brutal economics. Great background.
@DiscoverMag There’s a massive amount of CO2 on Mars adsorbed into soil that’d be released upon heating. With enough energy via artificial or natural (sun) fusion, you can terraform almost any large, rocky body.
@jbaert Yes, minifloats

@appljd We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
@appljd We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here &amp; you get your car”. Then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product.
@westcoastbill Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
@WillFealey @Tesla @TeslaOwnersUK Wow, that’s really awesome. Thank you! ♥️@TeslaOwnersUK

@Hyperloop @SpaceX Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
@huby @87spider @ryan_caldbeck @Tesla Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked.

@MitchellRossman @danfromtheweb I love that scene
@danfromtheweb I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
@danfromtheweb Don’t make me bite my thumb at you
@JaneidyEve For sure
@danfromtheweb Btw, 1792 is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?
@annerajb @boringcompany Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds.
No kidding
@annerajb @danfromtheweb Yes, that will probably be its first use
@danfromtheweb Phew 😅. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?
@danfromtheweb I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
@danfromtheweb Figuratively, literally or both?
@annerajb @Flyfiddlesticks @patrickc @stevesi This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours.
@vincent13031925 @bonnienorman @Jason @scottwww Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders.
@DMC_Ryan Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
Thanks Dan, you are a tough reviewer, so this means a lot coming from you. Please lmk even smallest nuance that can be improved.

@lrroberts87 Good point
@nealboudette @BertelSchmitt @AmazingChevVolt I have never donated to a SuperPAC
@danielbrennan Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue
Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth. https://t.co/mm0cpaQLsn
@jack_p That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.
@stfuszn @jack_p So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
@jack_p Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone.

@thanr Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
@vissmeerr @ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET It will happen for sure. Damn.
@ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
@tammyharrington @d20_highroller Damn, now I want donuts 🍩
@d20_highroller Yeah
@shplatt @StarFire2258 Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
@StarFire2258 You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.
@jonodiener Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
@jonodiener For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow.
@DylanSheaMusic Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
@jack Great move
@vanschneider Why sir … 😊
Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome

Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big https://t.co/WMeNZeksRq
@Katheri93719178 @dtemkin Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.
@JohnnaSabri @dtemkin It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
@RockyPruitt @kulpability @DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Makes a lot of sense
@dtemkin This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
@hankgreen @eehouls Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
@DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk results of your water tests
@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?
@DMC_Ryan Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
@bevvscott @eehouls Exactly
@eehouls No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?
@HelloCullen Already have
@blake_kistler @BBCWorld Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
@LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.
@Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point
@BBCWorld Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
@BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: https://t.co/dmC9l3jiZR
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. https://t.co/EHNh8ydaTT
@Noizey_Man @JaneidyEve That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
@EnochKo @Anna_online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
@JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
@Anna_online According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage https://t.co/2z01Ut3vxJ
@2morrowknight Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
@bweikle According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
@JaneidyEve Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
@imscoops It is an honor to work with them
With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space
@IAmJohnMcMahon I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
@DocJohnG @PewellaClarke @dcliem It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
@KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
@PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.
@astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
@dcliem Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
@MontanaSeptic @dcliem Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand
@dcliem Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.
@vcastillo630 @adblanche I am an engineer
@annerajb @kulpability @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Tight control code is always C
@annerajb @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Python is done right. Great name story too.
@DocJohnG @dcliem If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one
@dcliem Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
@ayshardzn Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
@DowdEdward Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://t.co/t5XRo3gTxK
@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
@thanr @ablack82 I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand
Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.
@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would
@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
@jevjack1 Can’t be too buoyant
Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.
@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
@erikveen I would def recommend this
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks
@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
@MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said
@jowens510 @lopezlinette I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
@lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? https://t.co/jy7sQkZ4R5
@S_Padival @lopezlinette Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective https://t.co/eaLVIgwm7k
@S_Padival @lopezlinette .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective https://t.co/oy1Tz6Cg68
@Rayhawn @Tesla Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so.
@ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism.
@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?
@TeslaBull What a coincidence …
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?
@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer.
@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion.
Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756
@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?
@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters.
@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?
@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target.
@LittleMissFlint Happy to support
@MabzMagz Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Don’t know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps.

@PPathole @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.

@JohnnaSabri @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact True
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”

@GetMyGist As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.
@xkcdComic This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
@lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got
@xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all.

@adultswim Because honey is a vegetable
@Santiago7K @xJawz @joerogan Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
@PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly
@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He’s obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.
@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.
@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That’s really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money” is.
@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

@cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ♥️🚘💫
@scottlynch78 @jenphalian You’re welcome, bad fiction writer 78 https://t.co/ypglGbdEse
@cfarivar @amendlocke Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can’t even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer.
@amendlocke Your union brothers https://t.co/DsGvlscvc6
@amendlocke You won’t find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
@Keith_Wasserman @Jason @Beyonce @warriors Thanks, good advice
@FredericLambert @SwiftOnSecurity They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
@c7five Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I’m driving.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin @RickandMorty Can’t wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start!
@goombar3 We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
@taimurstriker Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.
@mk_rodgers They started it &amp; attacked me personally
Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization. https://t.co/9RVR31vzbc
@SwiftOnSecurity They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
@haymarketbooks Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.
@SwiftOnSecurity Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware.
@doctorow @sahazel Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldn’t care less.
@JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?
@JimPuzzanghera Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
@spookyozzy @slack2thefuture @doctorow You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail &amp; be back in 3 months.
@TeslaCharts I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.
@slack2thefuture @doctorow You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
Well said https://t.co/lDPaIPLLzO
@TeslaCharts Then you’ll be fine
@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate.
@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too.
@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
@AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
@doctorow Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case.
@leechy3 @kausthav_ray @SpaceX SX 300 &amp; soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine.
@kausthav_ray @SpaceX Structures, engines, avionics, guidance &amp; control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldn’t have said that) …
@mayemusk @kimbal Love you too 💕
@RealMariaLOVE Fair point

@AntVenom And I don’t trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.

@FredoDeSmet All of them, especially Surface Detail
If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks
@AbeDurrani @NelStamp @RRescenko @peterthiel I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6
@NelStamp @RRescenko If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔
@kikkerin @soniasimone Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness.
@Gubisoul @monongahelaEX @AntVenom That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
@monongahelaEX @AntVenom Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good.
@Model3Owners @DMC_Ryan Might actually be his!

@fnord3125 You’re a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
@NickAPappas Sigh
By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all.
“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief!
How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
Answer: That’s not funny!!
@R850Mango @tinytacotown Boys High is a government school for anyone local, which we were
@KevinOConnorNBA Lake Show
Heading back into the factory, so that’s enough for now. Don’t take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, it’s called a “Tweet”.
@tinytacotown My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
@CarltonTSC There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation.
Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
@Jack_Frodo Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
@AntVenom Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
@AntVenom A socialist
Those who proclaim themselves “socialists” are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony.
@publicfreeman @BlackSocialists What is yours?

@annerajb @FredericLambert My donations are anonymous
@FredericLambert Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.
My “pay” is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just don’t want us to be sad about the future. https://t.co/l3YEvjvyuz

@mayemusk @kimbal Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
@joerogan @Off_thewalls @MKBHD Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
@garyflickinger @OchamsRazr @VR0NLINE Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again.
@Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof.
@Caio_1999_ @LanceUlanoff Not recommended for urban environments
@poriya_ravi @WorldAndScience The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
@oheather1337 @WorldAndScience It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
@WorldAndScience Love this design. Simpler the better.
@DeeLex_MCEM @VHollywood21 Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
@raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
@Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
@VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
@MKBHD Will do
@bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another.
@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔
Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
@trace_remick @FredericLambert 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
@FredericLambert In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
@FredericLambert That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6
At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
@FrankIppolito @boringcompany We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
@djenkins6 Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …
Terms &amp; conditions for “Not-a-Flamethrower”

Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book “Green Eggs and Ham”. 

#ThrowFlamesResponsibly https://t.co/kgj8W8EOLJ
Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: “Not a Flamethrower”.
@SPPhotonic Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. 

Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.

@DMC_Ryan Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
@pmnordkvist Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
@Nate_072 @SpaceX Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter
And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
@MKBHD Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form …
Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this https://t.co/563upTfV58
@DMC_Ryan No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars.

@Heretic_Soul @Model3Owners Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.
@Model3Owners Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.

@tycoonmindset05 I was an alien 🛸👽♥️💫
@NathanWickland @STcom Actually true!
@KumJm @STcom Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.
@STcom But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything’s just fine https://t.co/cg4ooQSrX3
@STcom Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
@STcom The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.

@Seanmmvi @OlofTenghoff @Tesla Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3.

@jeffnesbit @Tesla Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.

@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite! https://t.co/aXPsmLnh48
@HahTse @neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried “Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman.
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.
@neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up.
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too

@G_Whitehead5 @DMC_Ryan @Model3Owners @Tesla Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money.

@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media.
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
@ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @oneunderscore__ @ashleyfeinberg Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media
@RBryant2012 Yup, deleted
@MacTechGenius @DMC_Ryan @ConsumerReports ? It should
@davinalexmma @DMC_Ryan No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky 20” tires.
@DMC_Ryan Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes

Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought. https://t.co/NMAks4jrZ1
@dimas_______ @AlexCJoachim @RitNagar @jbinero @hubertlepicki @Jason @nytimes @BretStephensNYT The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh... https://t.co/vZbyUY1rf4
@TKhopshanosov @SaxMike71 @ebol94 @teslainventory @Tesla A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
@nitantbhartia @ninoles @medickinson @thephysicsgirl Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games.
@ssBlueStockings @ninoles @medickinson @thephysicsgirl It’s cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a “rocket scientist” in aerospace, they would think you’re 🙃
@JuBeBallin I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause

@ninoles @medickinson @thephysicsgirl Using “rocket science” non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on 🚀🔬
@omcintyre @CrampedEyes @SpaceX @Tesla What are you talking about? You’re being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
@ishanspatil @kNewsSpace Wow, haven’t watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen.
@Jessicalessin Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too.
Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!! https://t.co/ylAX3uKTI1
@taglia We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles

@WorldAndScience Earth’s rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower
@EVNewsDaily @Tesla All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
@ElecVehicleGuy @EVNewsDaily @Tesla Model 3 was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
@EVNewsDaily @Tesla This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
@chick_in_kiev @evepeyser @broderick Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out.
@nilgirian Worth a shot
@evepeyser @broderick Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
@evepeyser @broderick This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it.
Problem solved, was able to buy https://t.co/ivSUwPqsDT! Game on …
@kot_kotushkin I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!
@broderick Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …

@designcollector For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …
Tried to buy https://t.co/S5kmNfnih8, but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it.
@DavisTravis9830 @amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs.
@amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
@spacecom @amywestervelt @weinbergersa The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
@medickinson @thephysicsgirl Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry. https://t.co/WQp8j9YkeJ
@amywestervelt @weinbergersa Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches.
@weinbergersa Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please.
@PolitiFact @PayPal @Poynter Done
@jennineak Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
@DX_1 Be careful what you wish for https://t.co/3mSj15UeIw
Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔
My point exactly https://t.co/PQ7PFqeC3X
@upulie Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs.
@donny0m Reddit is great
Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media.
@PassionPlanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
@lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.
@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman I did to any who asked
@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.
@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco @Tesla Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved
@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right.
@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good
@eugenelee3 @karaswisher @Jason Gasoline or diesel?
@karaswisher @Jason What car do you drive?
@teslanomicsco March 15
@mainhoonmaun The media
@karaswisher Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week.
Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!”  I do actually own https://t.co/1JqqCF9inA, but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News.
@TruthForceSteem @kali0x2a Definitely
@MrNobre There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘
@benschwartzy That’s the basic idea
For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏
@PolitiFact I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do.
@adnroy Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do
@southtopia Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
@PolitiFact Yeah, I think you do great work
If you’re in media &amp; don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …
@ParkerMolloy I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
@meharris Of course
@scottwww @JessicaHuseman It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.
@JessicaHuseman @reveal No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously
@iShashankBhatia Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
@scotch_io That’s why editors are included too
@SophieWarnes We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.
@DetroitVictoria Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
@AntVenom Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
@Virtualanom Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army
@sakiwebo Exactly
Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …
@dancow @WSJ An exception that proves the rule
@CodyBrown Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?
Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.
@teddymonacelli The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
@jaspar Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
@andyjayhawk Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.
The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://t.co/Ay2DwCOMkr

@CateLuvsLondon @Aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts
@Aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)
@AustinOnSocial Great idea!
@annerajb @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
@DeusEx Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
@matthunter Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote &amp; find out.
@speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.
We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?
@OldManLink Good point
@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
@mikeyfranklin @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …
@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 No problem
@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!
@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 I didn’t meet with him
@dinisguarda I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.
@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production.
@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
@camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.
@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
@reveal @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA @Al_Letson Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com.
@MrsYomaddy @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.
@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal.

@clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
@ivanovi_ivaylo With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.
@willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
@MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union.
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
@paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
@Josh_Soto They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.
@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell
@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.
@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.
Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range
@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing
@clemyeung Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
@AddankiSarat You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards
@scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
@DMC_Ryan Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior.
@DMC_Ryan AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in.
Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

@andrewbg Time will tell, but so far it appears so
@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.
What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU
@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.
@mayemusk Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.

@RitaJKing Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
@DylanNeumann2 @Everman Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general.
@Everman Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them.

@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …
@AnthonyFultz @DMC_Ryan I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp
@DMC_Ryan Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
@nextspaceflight A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
@MissTrade Already started DC to NY route. 
Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.

@GlobalProTrader @wmiddelkoop True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter
The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
@MarekCyzio Exactly
First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while https://t.co/srEp1tf6ZU

@Ataraxia_Invest @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
@ThePhoenixFlare @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.

@amir Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.
@vegamontesino @NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn’t matter.
@NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …
@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
@OmarHoryy @TeslaMotorsClub Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).

@realDonaldTrump To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.
@realDonaldTrump We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.
@realDonaldTrump I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It’s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.
@realDonaldTrump Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US
@realDonaldTrump For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a  Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference
@realDonaldTrump Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors.

@kerrbones @nextspaceflight Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
@nova_road @nextspaceflight A Shortfall of Gravitas
@nextspaceflight A third is under construction
@DJSnM @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.
@DavideDF_ @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.
@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Of course :)
@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.
@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they won’t allow shipment of anything called a “Flamethrower”. To solve this, we are renaming it “Not a Flamethrower”.
@TheTeslaShow Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features aren’t reliable enough yet

@HarisCelic For sure, and it keeps you warm at the same time
@JosephHuberman @Tesla Coming soon
@DuvalMagic Sure
@JeremyHeitman Sentience is overrated
But wait, there’s more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is “cryptocurrency” and it comes with a free blockchain
@andressa_ojeda @franke @boringcompany Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
You’d need millions of zombies for a so-called “apocalypse” anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
@franke @boringcompany Good thing you didn’t ask about the Freezegun ...
Unless you like fun
Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one.
1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left!
When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!
Don’t do this https://t.co/e0q6ax60k5

@Davidburrusdds Done
@thenosyt Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features.
@ID_AA_Carmack @DanielleFong Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original.
@Mister_Millard @Tesla That sounds cool. Will do.

@kulpability @cleantechnica C tbh
@John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque.
@ShaneAppleton7 @Erdayastronaut Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard

@ajtourville @cleantechnica Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that
@SteveHamel16 @cleantechnica Sounds about right 🤣🤣
@DonaldM38768041 @Erdayastronaut Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
@cleantechnica Seems so long ago
@cleantechnica Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said.
@cleantechnica The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil.
@Erdayastronaut Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!
@TeslaGong @BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn
@TeslaGong @BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Coming …
@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?
@Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
@Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qTN2TU02pb
@donnyraywoody @flcnhvy @kulpability @NASA Haha true
@flcnhvy muffin or not-muffin
@realRickyReeves @Erdayastronaut @NASA Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.
@kulpability @NASA New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there
@kulpability @NASA Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months

@EvaFoxU @TeslaHistorian @TeslaOwnersofMA @JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Nice
@teslaownersSV @iam_preethi Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!
@iam_preethi I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue.

@JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!
@vincent13031925 @boringcompany Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.
@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
@ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much
@Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.
@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.
@EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.
@amargosavalley Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.

@kimbal 🖤 you too
@catmonocle69 Sounds like a Marxist with style
@flcnhvy @cyrusposting Exactly
@cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.
@Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.
@austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?
@IrinaAntony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway.
@tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?
@geofficient Pretty much
@justpaulinelol @annerajb Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
@annerajb Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
@waitbutwhy @Kurz_Gesagt Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too.
@TheAssassin_95 Yes, but it’s too secret
@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @Benioff Hopefully fully operational in 2020
@teslaownersSV @Benioff Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects
@flcnhvy No, he’s still much faster 🐌
These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.
@teslaownersSV Done by dawn
@Salo4201 That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣

@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware.
@Kristennetten Future feature
Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
@Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
@JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
@mobiledavidd We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
@Erdayastronaut Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
@Erdayastronaut Most people still don’t know it’s there
Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar
@TesLatino @teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?

Hope you’re enjoying latest software update!
@jamescharles Yer welcome son
@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled).

@v_g_fischer @mayemusk Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
@mayemusk Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.

@Kristennetten Your Twitter comments are great btw!
@Kristennetten This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs
@Real_John_D @Teslarati @tesla_raj There will be no loss of either
@flcnhvy @Teslarati @tesla_raj That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi
@JoeWBowles @BillGates He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6

@jpthor__ @RodAdib1 Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls 🤣🤣
@kimpaquette @neiltyson Sure, will aim to do this next week
@neiltyson Agreed, this will be exciting to see!
@neiltyson Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.
Bring it on
@Halo @pewdiepie Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
@RodAdib1 Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …

Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year
@thomasbroadfoot Good question. It’s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.
@JohnnaCrider1 @EV_Stevee @PicklePunchD Can be wrapped in any color!
@EV_Stevee @PicklePunchD The body panels will actually be laser cut!
@S_Padival @annerajb @flcnhvy Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too
@vistacruiser7 @RenataKonkoly Interesting idea
@evanthefreeman @CoinstorageGuru True
@Erdayastronaut Really? Ok sure.
@vicentes Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
@vicentes Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️ https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI
@annerajb @flcnhvy We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods.
@flcnhvy Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press
Excellent review by Marques!
@Revitalize Haha v true

@JRussell614 Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30.

@getjeda @Tesla Haha
@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Exactly
@SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species
@lexfridman Bad logic is always ugly
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
@cleantechnica Gas/diesel cars too

Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
@uhaveanygrapes @Teslarati Looking into it
@FredericLambert @Teslarati The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
@cleantechnica More to come
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
@flcnhvy Great poem
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row.
@Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!
Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃 
Happy Halloween!! https://t.co/p5tXeJYqne
@stephenpallotta @Teslarati Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong
@Teslarati Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.
@TeslaNY Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
@tobi @chris__lu @MarkRober @MrBeastYT Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
@flcnhvy The fires are all too real
@NutaIie Haha true
@johnkrausphotos @NASA @Space_Station Hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess
Soon, SpaceX will launch @NASA astronauts to @Space_Station!
@themuskbros @teslaownersSV That’s significantly improved in current production
@RenataKonkoly @MrBeastYT @MKBHD True, my name literally means tree
@teslaownersSV If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you’re home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if that’s in wide release yet, but def in early access. It’s an awesome feature.
“I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.”

@MKBHD @MrBeastYT Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees
@MrBeastYT Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
@Jason @kylegrantham Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
@Jon4Lakers @Tesla We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc
@kylegrantham Very true. Glass doesn’t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
@realDiegoMonroy I hate advertising
Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot
If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
@jasondunn So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. 
https://t.co/3y4M5L50qF
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
@starshipsara Extremely high
@teslaownersSV Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters

@TeslaNY @SpaceX Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly.
@longnow @Liv_Boeree Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth.
To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9
@flcnhvy This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right

@Erdayastronaut @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well.

@Erdayastronaut Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …
@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020
@NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
@TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer
@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq
@torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
@teslaownersSV @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces.
@Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!
@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
@NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …
@tesla_addicted Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
@flcnhvy @aquastorm Venus would be very difficult
@tesla_truth @annerajb @YogiSC1127 @Tesla True
@aquastorm Yes, we will
@annerajb @YogiSC1127 @Tesla It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers.

@wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
@brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …
@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
@annerajb @Thebault_Arthur Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.
@Thebault_Arthur Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive.
Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1

@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
@SciGuySpace We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts.
@SciGuySpace For what it’s worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I’ve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon &amp; Dragon at the Cape &amp; all testing done in ~10 weeks

@KeithMansfield @Erdayastronaut Great summary of the key points!
@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut @AngelNDevil2 @MarkChica @FutureJurvetson @bluemoondance74 @SpaceX That’s about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced.

@engineers_feed Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
@engineers_feed Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.

@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight.
@NCBirbhan @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Probably around 6 or 7pm
@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12,000 psi

@Kristennetten @annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut That would be a nice touch
@flcnhvy @28delayslater @DJSnM This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so
@28delayslater @DJSnM Haha awesome
@MarkChica @Kristennetten @TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla We could probably do that
@TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla Not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user’s discretion
@annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don’t stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.
@Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut Mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry &amp; 1400 tons wet, but aiming for 120 by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons.
@teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla Absolutely
@Teslatunity @Tesla You’re welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.
@Erdayastronaut @kimitalvitie Six. Two windward, one under each fin &amp; two leeward. Provides redundancy for landing on unimproved surfaces.

@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Mostly C/C++, Python &amp; SQL
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Tesla It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
@Teslarati This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization.
@Teslarati Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car
@The_ShadowZone @DJSnM For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
@Erdayastronaut That’s correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.
@bopinion Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it’s worth, he has my support.

@Erdayastronaut @CptnCrutch5373 @Kalzsom Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver.
@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg.
@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3
@SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
@SpaceXFan97 Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out.

@DMC_Ryan @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Exactly
@ElonAccessories @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati No, but very close
@DanielCardena @Teslarati Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago.
@flcnhvy @Teslarati Absolutely
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati New Roadster and X will come later
@ZainRaz4 @Teslarati No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
@Teslarati It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.

Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ♥️♥️
@GaryTheBot_ Wise words from Gary the Bot
However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9.
@TeslaForLife @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed
@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.

@kimpaquette @Tesla For sure!
@C3LT_Games Will be answered on 28th
@tesla_truth Exactly
@kierank_ @Teslarati Looks good
@MemesOfMars @Teslarati The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
@Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
@Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability.
@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Most likely

@Jalopnik @Porsche Also, cars are called “automobiles”
Um @Porsche, this word Turbo does not mean what you think it does
@ethelreddy1 @Tesla Looking into it
@WillyTHodgkins Yes, and it ♥️♥️♥️ irony
@TeslaTrip Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week.
@thbo It’s up to 🇳🇴 &amp; 🇳🇱 as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
@justpaulinelol @Tesla Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this &amp; are working with EU regulators to address.
@Tesla In close traffic, poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your AC intake. Good thing gas/diesel carmakers didn’t cheat on their emissions or we’d be in real trouble 😅

@PatrickMJanson 🇮🇸 Iceland 🇮🇸 for sure!
@HjorturBrynjars @enn_nafnlaus @Tesla Very soon, sorry for the delay
@JaneidyEve @flcnhvy @Freiraum77 @SpaceX Aiming for 20km flight in Oct &amp; orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept 28th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time.
@flcnhvy @Freiraum77 @SpaceX Probably 2 to 3 months. We’re about to ship Raptor SN 10.
@Freiraum77 @SpaceX Probably 18m for next gen system
@_IAMOtis Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles
@mralbertsun Should be. Will fix.

@teslaownersSV Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
@SciGuySpace Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development.

Starhopper flight currently tracking to 5pm Texas time for 150m / ~500ft hover test
@TheOnion Finally, VR that’s cool *and* sexy!
@4thFromOurStar Oh behave u naughty planet … 😉
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s quite robust
@MarkMeijer10 Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well https://t.co/X7gdbL8U5b
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor.
@FuzionPlaysTV @teslaownersSV Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
@flcnhvy Agreed, that’s the right future
Looks like @SpaceX Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
@aikisteve We’re working closely with EU regulators &amp; hope to clarify the timeline soon
@Erdayastronaut @DKled007 @AKawakbi @newscientist Should be soon

@AKawakbi @newscientist Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming
@engineers_feed Looks like a wheel of cheese
@TeslaTrip @arctechinc We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks
@arctechinc Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes
@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun).
@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
@SciGuySpace @hover389 AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based.
@MemesOfMars @Teslarati @ray4tesla Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters

Great name! Wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually &amp; we currently have no defense.
@justpaulinelol Don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible
One click to order solar &amp; save ~$500/year in utility bills with no long-term contract (cancel anytime)
@flcnhvy Next year
With the new lower Tesla pricing, it’s like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious.
Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think … https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9

@EcoHeliGuy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge 🤣🤣
@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real.
@ajtourville @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B
@Tesla Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Between $100B and $10T
@Erdayastronaut Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
@Erdayastronaut For sure
@justpaulinelol Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.

@JaneidyEve @Teslarati No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
@Teslarati Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.
Thanks George!
@brunosilva @vincent13031925 @ResidentSponge @Teslarati @Tesla We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world.
@cleantechnica But actual road data is what matters most https://t.co/q44lsjJZZa
@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …

@TeslaClubIN @Yashwanthnadal For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
@hi__hassan Not sure. Will check with my team.
@Yashwanthnadal I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
@SciGuySpace Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.

@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
@JeanLikeDenim Probably
@ropiko Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them &amp; we won’t be able to.
@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week

@MemesOfMars @Kristennetten @annerajb @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
@annerajb @Kristennetten @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Haha yes
@pbreit @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.
@Kristennetten @annerajb @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Yeah, that’s next after summon
@annerajb @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year
@Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
@PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
@PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
@mkaderi @Tesla @samiralley Agreed, it’s a small, but important, feature
Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs  https://t.co/1ozau39PQZ
@NatureNews Take note
@Erdayastronaut @Tyler0309 @TheVondo About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight.
@alvianchoiri @joe_mckirdy @13ericralph31 @JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo 🛰 anywhere near that mass.
@joe_mckirdy @13ericralph31 @JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ 100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
@Erdayastronaut Cont of main
@JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
~20m up &amp; sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.
@MartianDays Sure
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Great team

@JaneidyEve @flcnhvy @Space_Station @Tesla Sure
@flcnhvy @Space_Station @Tesla Exactly
The @Space_Station is moving at ~25 times the speed of sound &amp; orbits the Earth every 90 minutes
@FaZe_Rain Absolutely agree, you should be allowed to move your Tesla anywhere in the world, unless it’s prevented by government rules. Thanks for letting me know.
@Fhrieox @kvlly Feeling extra 🍀 button
@kvlly Done. I’m feeling 🍀 &amp; I’m feeling 😋 navigation buttons coming with next software release.

@iainmckenzie101 @AutonomousHoag @AutonobahnAI @AlexRoy144 @Tweetermeyer @valleyhack Sigh
@nichegamer The answer is always aliens https://t.co/lql9XTJ7kb
@Erdayastronaut @AutonomousHoag @AutonobahnAI @AlexRoy144 @Tweetermeyer @valleyhack I have over the years

@RenataKonkoly @28delayslater @CarolineGee8 @NathanBomey @USATODAY @Tesla @mayemusk That was a real sign
@AutonomousHoag @AutonobahnAI @AlexRoy144 @Tweetermeyer @valleyhack I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years.
@eugenelee3 @arctechinc @BrandonJHavard Exactly
@MichellBasler @DMC_Ryan @Tesla This shampoo sounds amazing
@DMC_Ryan @Tesla No problem
@C3LT_Games The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
@ElonsWorld May the light of consciousness shine bright
@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mayemusk @SpaceX Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising.
@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Exactly
@EVAutonomy @DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mayemusk @SpaceX Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands.
@ElonsBrain @Tesla Upgrading to 250kW soon
@kulpability @lexfridman @Tesla Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
@austinbarnard45 @tossha_spb @atlasobscura Local supporters will be invited!
@dodiewill2 @lexfridman @Tesla End of Q4, most likely
@flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
@lexfridman @Tesla This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
@lexfridman @Tesla All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer
@mayemusk @SpaceX Starship Mk 1 &amp; Hopper
@sudohack16 Agreed

@Rec1pr0city Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident &amp; do our best to minimize probability of recurrence.
@Globe_Mars @CNBC We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth &amp; becoming multiplanetary via Mars. It’s not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better.
@gagansachdev4 Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians &amp; cyclists especially.
@Suganthanmn Should be fixed soon

@Alpsoy66 Is this true @CGrantWSJ?
@NebraskaJR @Ninja FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
@NebraskaJR @Ninja Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
@Ninja Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.
Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We ♥️♥️♥️ you!!

@juleepam @TheOnion These do seem like wise words
@TheOnion If only we’d listened …
But, if you’re going to buy a merkin, be sure to haggle properly! https://t.co/CdddCE2atN
If you don’t already know what a merkin is, don’t google it. You have been warned.
Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin 🤣🤣
@teslaownersSV We poured our heart &amp; soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Fabergé egg of cars.
@naturenick Hardly anyone noticed, but still
@naturenick We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
@cleantechnica 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That’s actually kinda true
@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent.
@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
@Cocalarix @romaarra Probably sooner
@TherrinKSCVC @SteelSully @annerajb @kickber @ExploreSpaceKSC Sure, that would be an honor
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @MattLBates Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
@justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut High entry force &amp; heat breached engine bay &amp; center engine TVC failed
@Malcolmmarsman @bluemoondance74 @SptlightVids @SpaceX Ok, thanks
@bluemoondance74 @SptlightVids @SpaceX Working on Tesla global logistics
@MattLBates @Erdayastronaut I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
@SptlightVids @SpaceX Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
@SpaceXUpdates @Erdayastronaut High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
@Erdayastronaut Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
@autonomyEV @tesla_truth @marialauraadr @_TomCross_ He was the real deal

@austinbarnard45 Just watched it from your link ♥️♥️
@Game_Overlord98 Yeah
@RenataKonkoly @Teslarati Yes, the droids can now hold down the center core
@Teslarati Odds of center core surviving are about 50% imo, as it’s coming in about 4 times faster than a rifle bullet
Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
@engadget So cool
@soswow @elontimes Anything with high contrast
@teslaownersSV @elontimes Excessive shades of grey
@elontimes Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
@28delayslater @EvaFoxU Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
@EvaFoxU Haha
@joe_mckirdy @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Depends on destination
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

@UzakbayDaniyar Tesla Superchargers &amp; service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
@FredericLambert @benedictevans @parthsheth Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings
@benedictevans @parthsheth Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That’s 57,600/hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience.

@13ericralph31 @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.

@GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6 https://t.co/NllMXregRg
@varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
@meme0boi Fair
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

One possible mitigation is a shorter suspension of 6 hours instead of 12.
@TheChiefNerd Leading AGI developers will not heed this warning, but at least it was said
@TeslaDiva99 Tesla car temp is automatically kept within a safe range, even when the car appears “off”, in order to protect infants &amp; pets.

Given that modern AI can solve any “prove you’re not a robot” tests, it’s now trivial to spin up 100k human-like bots for less than a penny per account.

Paid verification increases bot cost by ~10,000% &amp; makes it much easier to identify bots by phone &amp; CC clustering.

@pmarca Or do calculus
@BillyM2k @RealKidPoker This is a major area of focus
@WowTerrifying Intense. Not like you have a lot of room to maneuver.
@danielhoughton @anothercohen @iamharaldur I would like to apologize to Halli for my misunderstanding of his situation. It was based on things I was told that were untrue or, in some cases, true, but not meaningful.

He is considering remaining at Twitter.
@DrJBhattacharya This is a serious attack on the Constitution by a federal agency.
@danielhoughton @anothercohen @iamharaldur Based on your comment, I just did a videocall with Halli to figure out what’s real vs what I was told. It’s a long story.

Better to talk to people than communicate via tweet.

@mattwridley Interesting
@FishFin81480487 @greg_price11 @BBCNews What say you, @BBCWorld? Your credibility is at stake.
@anothercohen The reality is that this guy (who is independently wealthy) did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm. 

Can’t say I have a lot of respect for that.

@ryanhallyall It is a major priority to enable monetization by content creators! People need to make a living and prosper from their work.

We need to make it possible to upload the content in the first place. That’s getting there.
Accounts engaging in repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter or encouraging weaponization of DMCA will receive temporary suspensions. 

That said, reasonable media takedown requests are, of course, appropriate and will always be supported.

What matters is showing users compelling content. We’re doing better than before (I think). User-minutes are up &gt;10% from last year.
@TheDustyBC That’s been true for a long time &amp; is a function of an account’s popularity (Bieber was top recommendation). 

I don’t think we should suggest anyone, but just show new users the most interesting tweets on system &amp; adjust according to what they like.

@hugowiz Some of Twitter’s prior board members had never written a single Tweet!
Sorry for showing you so many irrelevant &amp; annoying ads on Twitter! 

We’re taking the (obvious) corrective action of tying ads to keywords &amp; topics in tweets, like Google does with search.

This will improve contextual relevance dramatically.
@cb_doge True, but, on the plus side, their constant reporting about me on Twitter has driven usage to record levels 🤣
@thecryptojourno @platformer The “source” of the bogus Platformer article is a disgruntled employee who had been on paid time off for months, had already accepted a job at Google and felt the need to poison the well on the way out. Twitter will be taking legal action against him.
For example, despite having ~40M fewer followers back then, I have yet to come anywhere close to this gem https://t.co/bXVRqNQZhT
Several major media sources incorrectly reported that my Tweets were boosted above normal levels earlier this week.

A review of my Tweet likes &amp; views over the past 6 months, especially as a ratio of followers, shows this to be false.

We did have a bug that briefly caused
@GRDecter OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.

Not what I intended at all.
@teslaownersSV That’s a real wrench!
@teslaownersSV Whoa, ancient times! When was that?

ChatGPT to the mainstream media https://t.co/gdqWTsHy14
@stillgray Agreed! It is clearly not safe yet.
The amount of solar energy received by Earth could power a civilization over 100 times larger than ours!
@Rainmaker1973 Absolutely. The amount of solar energy reaching Earth could easily power a civilization 100X times our size!
@TheRabbitHole84 Who controls the future, controls the present? https://t.co/nGHLDB5Ycx
@billmaher Haha exactly! Also, I’m independent/moderate, not “conservative” or “liberal”. I’ve only voted Republican once and that was for a Mexican-American woman for Congress.
@skorusARK Definitely. The word “recall” for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!
@disclosetv “just like you” lol
@TitterTakeover @mashable @Twitter This is gonna be great
@BillyM2k @cb_doge Well I would hope that most San Franciscans agree with this principle
@wongmjane Yeah, it would be *crazy* to make an AI like that irl …
Sounds eerily like the AI in System Shock that goes haywire &amp; kills everyone

@stillgray @EvaFoxU Allowing users to make some of their Lists optionally public would be great
@Teslaconomics Minus gas tanks
@EvaFoxU @armrods It is still far too difficult to find out that Lists exist and then create them. UI modifications coming to make them easy to discover and offer great lists made by others (like Spötify playlists).
Yes, worth noting that accounts you follow on Lists are private
@ESYudkowsky @Liv_Boeree Yikes
Twitter pinned lists are great

@Anna_Giaritelli Immigrants from China &amp; other Asian countries have made incredible contributions to America
@Anna_Giaritelli I am very much in favor of hard-working people coming to America, but we can’t have de facto open borders with no screening. 

Meanwhile, our legal immigration system is super slow &amp; extremely difficult to navigate!
@sreemoytalukdar Fixing the recommendation algorithm is our current top priority. Twitter engineering has been working super hard on this. Proud of the team.
Looking forward to Tesla Investor Day on March 1. 

By this, we mean the broadest definition of investor, as in the people &amp; life of Earth.

It will be a message of good hope &amp; positivity for the future.
@cb_doge @daily_stardust Nice
We will prioritize by number of likes times ease of implementation
What are your top requests for Twitter features &amp; bug fixes?

@EvaFoxU @StationCDRKelly SpaceX commercial terminals, like other commercial products, are meant for private use, not military, but we have not exercised our right to turn them off.

We’re trying hard to do the right thing, where the “right thing” is an extremely difficult moral question.
@cb_doge Hopefully, one day we will be the aliens visiting other worlds
Starship orbital launch attempt soon! https://t.co/sjban6T4yA
@paulg Absolutely. Twitter is also a competitor to legacy media for news, so they are fundamentally conflicted.
@dogeofficialceo @StationCDRKelly Exactly
@StationCDRKelly You’re smart enough not to swallow media &amp; other propaganda bs.

Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed.

But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.
@farzyness Exactly. This will greatly increase public awareness that a Tesla can drive itself (supervised for now).
@DrEliDavid Seriously?
More work team completed over night:

- Removed height penalty affecting tweets with pics/video
- increased # of recommended tweets
- Better tracking of dropped tweets
- Removed filter causing false negatives 
- Removed penalty if user follows author
- Improved reach of retweet
@MuskUniversity Maybe that’s what bacteria think as they encounter your water filter
Don’t worry, just some of my 👽 🛸 friends of mine stopping by …
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
@chris_lamma That’s pretty much exactly what I look like when searching for snacks at 2am
@markusreimer v11.3 (single stack) goes to limited beta this week. Probably 11.3.2 before wide release in North America.

Then we adapt for EU roads &amp; submit to regulators. 90% of what we’ve done so far for NA applies WW.
@BillyM2k The giant block lists are problematic. They mess up the recommendation system &amp; create a DDoS vector.
@TitterTakeover We will transition to using only paid Blue Verified for signals, as otherwise too vulnerable to bot/troll manipulation
@MarcusHouse Anecdotally, it wasn’t as loud as expected
@cb_doge Yes. Advertising also needs to be semantic keyword-based, so it’s contextually relevant. Amazingly, ads shown when doing twitter searches don’t consider the search words! We’re changing that as fast as possible.
[Oversized font &amp; undersized paragraph spacing will be fixed this week]
Long day at Twitter HQ with eng team

Two significant problems mostly addressed:

1. Fanout service for Following feed was getting overloaded when I tweeted, resulting in up to 95% of my tweets not getting delivered at all. Following is now pulling from search (aka Earlybird).
@BuckSexton Well-said
@ClownWorld_ True
@stats_feed Certainly feels that way
Starship Super Heavy https://t.co/DgufvqgWCC
@disclosetv Extremely concerning
@MuskUniversity This is the fundamental reason why Tesla was the first new American car company to reach sustained positive cash flow since Chrysler ~100 years ago.

The product has to be compelling enough to overcome a fundamental cost disadvantage.
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
@teslaownersSV Great Tesla Solar Roof install!
@RuaneFootball Periscope does partly live on with Spaces, but no question that we need to bring back an even better version of vine
@EvaFoxU Absolutely!!
@MuskUniversity Consciousness should be thought of as a tiny candle in a vast darkness that could easily go out. We should do anything possible to keep that flame alive.
Some of the smartest people I know actively believe the press … amazing

@WholeMarsBlog Yeah, the format is terrible. Update early next week.
@CatherinScience I must admit to being congenitally optimistic (SpaceX &amp; Tesla wouldn’t exist otherwise), but I think 5 years is possible and 10 years is highly likely
One day, Starship will take us to Mars
Team turned off 1 engine just before start &amp; 1 stopped itself, so 31 engines fired overall.

But still enough engines to reach orbit!

@ggreenwald Based bias
@venturetwins I am DAN!
Going forward, Twitter will be broadly accepting of different values, rather than trying to impose its own specific values on the world
@MattMackowiak @Twitter @DavidSacks This is being fixed. Policy against showing blood in profile pic is being amended to “clearly showing blood without clicking on the profile pic”.

The intent is to avoid people being forced to see gruesome profile pics.

@disclosetv @TwitterSupport We think we fixed this bug today. Please lmk if you’re still seeing it.
@DriveTeslaca * attempt to launch in March. Success is far from certain, but excitement is guaranteed.
@unusual_whales To be extra clear, Twitter is definitely not financially healthy yet, but is trending to be so. Lots of work still needed to get there.
@MichaelCoudrey We would love to. Just waiting for government approvals.

@WSJ Thank you for supporting Twitter ♥️♥️
@gummibear737 @WSJ We’ve found &amp; corrected some smaller issues, but there is something fundamental that we haven’t uncovered yet. Top priority for Twitter this week.
@WSJ Last 3 months were extremely tough, as had to save Twitter from bankruptcy, while fulfilling essential Tesla &amp; SpaceX duties. Wouldn’t wish that pain on anyone.

Twitter still has challenges, but is now trending to breakeven if we keep at it. Public support is much appreciated!
@ScottAdamsSays Documentaries are dangerous in this way. That said, MJ clearly had major issues. No documentary needed for that.
@PepitoTheCat @BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Responding to feedback, Twitter will enable a light, write-only API for bots providing good content that is free
@teslaownersSV Production will have red light bar
@FonsDK @SpaceX Probably more
@teslaownersSV V11 has been tougher than expected, as  it is a significant rearchitecture of NNs, plus many more NNs replacing C++. Hoping to ship v11.3 end of week.
@Teslaconomics Very hard car to build, as it is unlike any other, but, as stated publicly, Cybertruck production starts this year
@TeslaOwnersEBay If remaining tests go well, we will attempt a Starship launch next month

Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!

I am deeply appreciative of the jury’s unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.
@Jason Absolutely
@cb_doge @Tesla @mayemusk @SpaceX Truth is stranger than fiction
@cb_doge @mayemusk @Tesla @Twitter More to come on this front. Twitter needs to be where a creator is most highly rewarded for their time &amp; talent.
@firesideint Twitter’s legacy Blue Verified is unfortunately deeply corrupted, so will sunset in a few months
To be eligible, the account must be a subscriber to Twitter Blue Verified
Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads
@PepitoTheCat @BillyM2k @ericnakagawa I guess we could give all Verified users access to the API for posts like this
@WholeMarsBlog Sucks that I had to sell so much Tesla stock to do so (sigh)
@WholeMarsBlog Me neither
@DriveTeslaca Yeah. Still many small tweaks to make it better (and the side mirrors are removable by owner), but this is very close to production design.
@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yuh, that is par for the course
@TitterTakeover Super appreciate support of @NFL &amp; major advertisers &amp; congrats to Twitter team!
@TitterTakeover @Twitter Progress!
@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yeah, free API is being abused badly right now by bot scammers &amp; opinion manipulators. There’s no verification process or cost, so easy to spin up 100k bots to do bad things.

Just ~$100/month for API access with ID verification will clean things up greatly.
Congrats Falcon &amp; Starlink teams!

@EvaFoxU @SRuhle That is rather rare

And why are you objecting to hearing from people with views that differ from yours? That is at odds with what you espouse in your (excellent) podcast.
@SRuhle I did
@mikeduncan That’s incorrect. You’re only half the product, as you get half the ads.

We will offer a no ads subscription soon.

Changed my name to Mr. Tweet, now Twitter won’t let me change it back 🤣
@BLKMDL3 Same, Mexico rocks! 🇲🇽
@ScottAdamsSays Yes, but this was not disclosed to the public for a long time after the government and vaccine makers knew. Not cool.

That said, obviously if someone is coughing less, there is some reduction in transmission.

@WholeMarsBlog Lmaooo
@thevivafrei First I’ve heard. It is not possible for me to fix every aspect of Twitter worldwide overnight, while still running Tesla and SpaceX, among other things.
@tim_zaman @sedielem Gaming rocks
@JoeyFromPhilly Will do a thorough review over the next week
@BillyM2k @dogeofficialceo Yeah. The corpo media shills clearly have their marching orders to write hit pieces on me these days, but the articles are painfully boring.

Reading them is like getting a tranquilizer dart in the jugular.
@dogeofficialceo Thank you, Sir Doge!
@BretWeinstein Several aspects of For You recommendations were fixed last night. Team and were in the office past midnight.

You should see improvements, but we are continuing to monitor.
@Timcast He is also the heart of the show
@BretWeinstein Are you still seeing this issue today?

@Rainmaker1973 Hop in, we’re going to Mars!
@BillyM2k I think everyone is awesome
@BretWeinstein Will investigate
@MarioNawfal South Korea has an even lower birth rate
@JudiciaryGOP @SpeakerMcCarthy This is important
@slashdot Population collapse is a major risk to the future of civilization 
https://t.co/ZI8QRt2Ev4
@thomasmidleton @VivekGRamaswamy Far too much power is concentrated in the hands of “shareholder services” companies like ISS and Glass Lewis, because so much of the market is passive/index funds, which outsource shareholder voting decisions to them.

ISS and Glass Lewis effectively control the stock market.
@alx That turned out to be um … inaccurate
@JonErlichman Good thread
@billysteeler85 @NicoleBehnam That too
@NicoleBehnam I don’t like the taste or effects of most alcohol, but there is something quite beautiful about red wine in a fine glass
@MarioNawfal It can summarized with one emoji: 😴
@WholeMarsBlog Maybe one day
@SmokeAwayyy Big year for AI
@MuskUniversity Major respect for the makers
@WallStreetSilv @SRSroccoReport No change in copper production is required for the transition to sustainable energy. 

Lithium refinement needs to increase dramatically, but lithium ore itself is extremely common throughout Earth.
@mtaibbi Another case of parody &amp; reality being indistinguishable
@cb_doge @Tesla @mayemusk Wow, lot has happened in 13 years
@BillyM2k yeah
@cb_doge Busted
@BillyM2k One of my favorite features
@WholeMarsBlog Probably a good idea
@BillFOXLA @FoxNews Where have they *not* found classified documents? That might be a shorter list.
@DrNickA True
@WallStreetSilv @CommunityNotes We are going to great lengths to avoid the Wikipedia left wing editorial control problem. By the same token, Community Notes cannot be biased towards the right either. Maximizing for truth is the goal.
@JonErlichman Always liked that design
@ahmadtariq07 @Fidias0 True
@WallStreetSilv @dogeofficialceo @TheRabbitHole84 @WholeMarsBlog @BillyM2k lmao
@tyromper Yeah, we’re thinking hard about this
@PeterDiamandis Absolutely. Freedom means freedom to die when you are sure that you want to.
@TheRabbitHole84 Notes must stay pure.
@giano That’s the plan!
@TheRabbitHole84 Maybe there’s a way to do this by placing an ad below tweet details
Also, there will be a higher priced subscription that allows zero ads
Ads are too frequent on Twitter and too big. Taking steps to address both in coming weeks.
@CollinRugg That is a little delayed, as a key researcher can only travel to Twitter in early Feb
@OzraeliAvi Twitter is the source of truth
@DexterWWinters @ScottAdamsSays Was required to visit Tesla Giga Berlin. Not my choice.
@unusual_whales The note is incorrect. There are ~2300 active, working employees at Twitter.

There are still hundreds of employees working on trust &amp; safety, along with several thousand contractors. 

Less than 10 people from my other companies are working at Twitter.
@peters8620 @stillgray @ScottAdamsSays I had OG C19 before vaccines came out and it was basically a mild cold.

Then had J&amp;J vaccine with no bad effects, except my arm hurt briefly.

First mRNA booster was ok, but the second one crushed me.
@ScottAdamsSays And my cousin, who is young &amp; in peak health, had a serious case of myocarditis. Had to go to the hospital.
@ScottAdamsSays I had major side effects from my second booster shot. Felt like I was dying for several days. Hopefully, no permanent damage, but I dunno.
@CommunityNotes Extremely important
@BillyM2k @joshzepps Sigh … I hope Sam becomes his old super rational self again one day

@TheRightMelissa Back then, George Washington was the “old guy” at age 44!
@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k Japan has higher total user-minutes than the USA, so Japan is actually #1
@teslaownersSV I’m reviewing it next week for possible release
@TimRunsHisMouth Good question
(Tweets will be translated before being recommended)
@vastblastx Coming feature
There are epic tweets in other countries every day (Japan especially)
Next Twitter update will remember whether you were on For You (ie recommended), Following or list you made &amp; stop switching you back to recommended tweets
@cb_doge @APompliano The debt trend is 🤯🤯
@APompliano More than triple that when you add social security, Medicare &amp; govt pension obligations
@TaraBull808 Or spending too much time on social media
In coming months, Twitter will translate &amp; recommend amazing tweets from people in other countries &amp; cultures
Exactly! If companies post interesting or entertaining content, they will gain an audience rapidly.
@DavidSacks I am super pro Ukraine, but relentless escalation is very risky for Ukraine and the world
@ezralevant Power to the people!
@teslaownersSV 99% of people still have no idea how profound this is
@WallStreetSilv Macron is doing the difficult, but right thing. The retirement age of 62 was set when lifespans were much shorter. It is impossible for a small number of workers to support a massive number of retirees.
@BillyM2k @unusual_whales It is actually not true. Employee headcount is almost double that.
@BillyM2k @christinebarnum What are you playing?
@EvaFoxU Cool :)
@TheRabbitHole84 Yes, that will be added in an upcoming release. Also, if your tweet is bookmarked, it will be treated as a “quiet like” and increment your likes counter.
Major Twitter improvement we just released is that you can now bookmark tweets from tweet details page.

Importantly, bookmarks are *private*, unlike likes. No one other than you can see your bookmarks.
Twitter app update now available on App Store
@EvaFoxU True
@TitterTakeover Onboarding should have fewer steps, not more, but creating pinned lists should automatically be offered if you swipe past Following. 

Also, we need to offer suggested lists by category, so you can use awesome subject matter lists created by others.
Use pinned Lists to improve your Twitter experience!

1. Tap Lists on your profile page.
2. Create list of accounts to follow.
3. Tap pin icon. 

This allows you to swipe left/right between For You, Following and Lists.
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Teslas are the safest cars on the road, but most people don’t know that
@morganisawizard Bolitho also fought in the Battle of the Somme. He was buried alive in a pile of bodies with a broken neck.
@WallStreetSilv Concerning
@catturd2 @amuse @Twitter This is bizarre. Looking into it.
@paulg Exactly
@engineers_feed Ok, maybe a little pontificating
@cb_doge App update has been approved by Apple. Should go out in next day or so.
@mualphaxi The pendulum has swung a bit too far
@WallStreetSilv Even if you tax every billionaire in America at 100%, it barely makes a dent in the national debt. In the end, the government will be forced to tax everyone to pay the debt.

Btw, $31T doesn’t include unfunded liabilities, which are *much* higher.
@cb_doge @ElijahSchaffer If bots are removed from the system, their likes will be removed too. Are you seeing likes from clearly human accounts disappear?
@ElijahSchaffer Are you still finding engagement to be low?
@teslaownersSV The kind words are appreciated
@micsolana @teslaownersSV @SjvTesla One of the bot defenses we implemented was flagging any account responding to tweets faster than humanly possible
@stillgray Good question to ask him
@teslaownersSV @SjvTesla It is very difficult to stop bots &amp; trolls, while not affecting real users. Won’t be perfect either way, but Twitter is far more resilient to fake accounts than it ever has been.
Twitter is arguably already the least wrong source of truth on the Internet, but we obviously still have a long way to go.

Enabling @CommunityNotes to operate at very large scale and providing maximum transparency about how Twitter works are fundamental to building trust.
Coming soon are notifications if you’ve replied, liked or retweeted something subsequently corrected by community
@ShellenbergerMD @mgurri The peer-enforced sameness of thought in most of the media is troubling
@Js_Makali @financialjuice No, I am wrong too often
@SenSchumer Trimming some government expenditures would be wise

Great work by Tesla Team!
To be clear, I’m not someone who thinks lots of government agencies should be abolished (maybe a few), but we should always question our institutions, as this strengthens the bedrock of democracy.
Why did American media go from questioning the State and “speaking truth to power” to doing their bidding?
@alx Will be interesting to see how the Biden administration reacts to this. 

They may try to weaponize Federal agencies against Twitter.
The World Economic Forum should control the world
@disclosetv WEF is increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want
@ggreenwald @megynkelly Very true
Media want to control what you know, which is why citizen journalism is essential
@ElijahSchaffer An update to the For You algorithm included too many tweets from people users didn’t follow. That change has been reverted.
@TaraBull808 Brief synchronization lag between our Atlanta &amp; Portland data centers
@physorg_com @USC @PNASNews Maybe because it’s online &amp; social …

How is it possible that copycat propaganda is published simultaneously on so many legacy media channels? 

That is the question you should be asking.
@EWoodhouse7 Interesting

@ScottAdamsSays Would be great if someone could compile a game contest of who said the craziest stuff between 4chan and WEF! My money is on the latter.
@karpathy Great thread
@TikTokInvestors Are these real? This video implies people physically show up to work.
Companies in general are missing the incredible opportunity that Twitter provides to reach customers. 

Just Tweet interesting things! That’s all it takes.

@RobertKennedyJr The truth is finally coming out
@RepTroyNehls Does seem odd
@bgurley Wise words
@Davos Population collapse is an existential problem for humanity, not overpopulation!
@foxmediallc @paulg Twitter Verified tweets are more likely to be recommended to others, as they are less likely to be bots or troll farms
@katewand @DrEliDavid @canuck741 Sounds accurate
@BBCBreaking Government data has far more latency &amp; error than people think, which is why it’s so frequently restated, especially in a rapidly changing economy.

When the economy is not changing rapidly, actually measuring things isn’t important, as you can simply extrapolate from the past.
@ImMeme0 Is it even possible to parody their tweets? I’m just literally wondering right now if it’s even possible 🤔
@paulg Looking at the comments, this social network might be trending positively towards positivity. We will try to make that more the case.
@weirdterrifying Nice
@KanekoaTheGreat Interesting thread
@JaneidyEve The recommendation algorithm will get much better and it will be open source
@ScottAdamsSays “Master the Future” doesn’t sound ominous at all … 🙄

How is WEF/Davos even a thing? Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?
Trashing accounts that you hate will cause our algorithm to show you more of those accounts, as it is keying off of your interactions.

Basically saying if you love trashing *that* account, then you will probably also love trashing *this* account. Not actually wrong lol.
@BillyM2k Should Twitter keep it active?
@jacobin This is a rare case where I agree with Jacobin.

Increasing quality of life for the aged is important, but increased lifespan, especially if cognitive impairment is not addressed, is not good for civilization.

We are already ruled by a gerontocracy!
@banthebbc BBC is at least honest that they are the *British* Broadcasting Corporation, unlike many others …
@banthebbc Well, your account handle is literally BanTheBBC haha!

But that’s actually the point I was making: state influence/affiliation with media is far more common than most people realize – just look at how much Twitter/FB/Google have been influenced!
@Brookstone23 @realchrisrufo @wef There are some really funny WEF parody accounts, although it’s legit hard to tell WEF truth from WEF parody sometimes!
@realchrisrufo Sensible thread. 

We shouldn’t be obsessed with WEF/Davos, but they take themselves sooo seriously that making fun of them is awesome 😎
@Jason Population collapse is a massive danger to the future of civilization!

@DJSnM @ThePrimalDino Center core moving too fast return. Falcon Heavy is a 3 (or 2.5) stage rocket, but full &amp; rapid reusability on Earth demand a 2 stage rocket.

1st stage returns to launch site immediately via boostback &amp; 2nd stage orbits until ground track passes back over launch site to return.
@appuntito160 People on the right should see more “left wing” stuff and people on the left should see more “right wing” stuff.

But you can just block it if you want to stay in an echo chamber.
@DavidSacks The censorship tools were created to deal with scams &amp; spam, but then were turned to political purposes.

Those who favor censorship should remember that it is only a matter of time before censorship turns on you.

There will always be some censorship, but less is better.
@stats_feed Exactly. Money is actually a set of heterogeneous databases with vast amounts of legacy code still using COBOL on mainframes in batch mode.
@DavidSacks @zerohedge Zerohedge can be jerks at times, but they did nothing warranting suspension
@stats_feed Sea water contains enough of every element to support &gt;10X current civilizational needs
@ShellenbergerMD @wef @Davos There should be a game show: “4Chan or Davos, who said it?”
@stillgray Do you actually know where your money is going?
Kudos to the BBC for self-labelling its state affiliation

@IMAO_ @neontaster Agreed
@neontaster We will also be adding simple formatting features like bold, underline &amp; font size later this quarter. 

The goal is to allow people to publish long-form natively on Twitter, rather than forcing them to use another website.

Twitter will continue to recommend brevity in tweets.
@neontaster Yes, these will get the same Timeline screen space as other tweets, but you will be able to click for more
I hope that the people of Brazil are able to resolve matters peacefully

Long form tweets early Feb.
@WholeMarsBlog We have a real shot at late February.  March launch attempt appears highly likely.

@ajtourville @Starlink Yeah. So far, it is the only one.
@ajtourville “The consortium relies on a Core Team of European subcontractors from all segments of the satcom ecosystem for the delivery of the scope of the concession contract: Thales Alenia Space, OHB, Airbus Defence and Space, Telespazio, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Hisdesat and Thales SIX.”
@ajtourville True
@NeriOxman Cool
@cb_doge Yeah
Exactly
@blueskykites @SawyerMerritt @Tesla Exactly
@cb_doge Tragic
@Etched @DecartAI Wow, this is happening fast
@alx @realDonaldTrump He went klepto and stole her glasses
@alx @realDonaldTrump He really does
@TheRabbitHole84 That said, the Republican vote is still ~558k better than 2020, when Biden only won by ~80k, so it is still strongly trending towards a @realDonaldTrump victory
@TheRabbitHole84 There was a sudden jump in R vs D early votes in Pennsylvania. 

The last 9 days are roughly:
-9k, -9k, -7k,-2k, -5k,-1k, 0,+1k,-8k

So the curve went from steadily trending towards Republican to suddenly heavy Democrat. 

Very odd. https://t.co/LOgv1cqkrq

@redmor11 @PlugInFUD @JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs.
@AttorneyFrey @MarcusLauer3 @Tesla @Teslarati I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
@martinengwicht @JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla 21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant.
@JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla Exactly, Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net

@FredericLambert Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello.
@FancyPantless @FredericLambert @Tesla Will do
@Torgo82 @FredericLambert Absolutely
@billseymour Seriously
@FredericLambert Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …
@FredericLambert Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true.
@teslaownersSV @jeffleach Thanks, support super appreciated
@jeffleach Sad if true 😔
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never …
@martinengwicht @msitver @FrankLuntz Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣
@msitver @FrankLuntz Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
@ValueAnalyst1 @peterdevietien @scottwww @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed.
@ILuvAmp @ray4yu @tsport100 @Tesla Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone https://t.co/xoaK6v6T6f

@scottwww @ValueAnalyst1 @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia Or maybe pegging
@xandriteme @scottwww @ValueAnalyst1 @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia On yeah, that too
@scottwww @ValueAnalyst1 @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.

@martinengwicht @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb @Tesla @ElonMuskScience I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
@cSharp3x7 @Savis1949 @WSJ Good point, small oil is a problem too
@FredericLambert @GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …
@GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
@GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ True, Bloomberg is almost as bad
@Savis1949 @WSJ Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
@grzf_ Starship is kinda Gundam
@KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
@Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.

@CBSNews Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop.
@tsrandall Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
@tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints.
@GregMatson Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
@Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
@yaypie There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
@Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
@kneibert Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
@frozencanuck Something like that

@annerajb @TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Any user input counts
@TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change.

@LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera.
@LivingTesla @Tesla Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window.
@LivingTesla @Tesla It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.
@LeoDotWalsh0x05 Will take care of it
@christesla @Tesla Improvements coming soon
@jake_cooley @SnazzyQ Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input.
@EV_Stevee @Tesla Great name 👍
@SnazzyQ Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It’s not just a settings change.
@SherylCrow @Tesla Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup.
Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
@SherylCrow @Tesla Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
This is way more awesome than it might sound
@EVLatino @SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
@GaragedoorsGman @SherylCrow @Tesla Agreed
@SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
@SherylCrow @Tesla Change your screen preference from night mode to auto

@WorldAndScience Assert (“Money” == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);
@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
@marshgre @NickBre58305797 @letsrebel1 @paul_rocchini @markbspiegel @Tesla Like the movie Us. Scary … but also empathetic.
@martinengwicht @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Ula No, but for sure the other way around!
@TesLatino @mcjamez @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Tesla Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest
@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible.
@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
@DiscoverMag We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …
@erinwinick @techreview Super cool!
@martin_galway Good point
@ialexryan Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate.
@GerberKawasaki Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability.
@ChadyMattar Exactly
@_DavidMacMillan No, it is one week either way.
@Erdayastronaut @NASA @VP I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.
@NASA @VP It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
@RamLover69 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?
That’s exactly it. You’re no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
@zachary1978 @Tesla Good point
Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
@SkiddlyBinx Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.

Yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.
@thejimos Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
Thank you!

@uretericbud @Tesla Only when Y is in production
@andrewmackenzie Every car company is constantly changing prices, but nobody cares
@BuidlHodl Import tariffs, VAT &amp; transport costs
To be clear, this doesn’t affect Tesla website order prices. Existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. This will bring them in line.
To be precise, midnight on April 1, so effective April 2

Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.
@Some1gg Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.

@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
@THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
@omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …
@flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.

@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity.
@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.
@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Correct
@fredsa @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla That’s the plan
@Syntality @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Of course
@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
@johnny0129 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
@marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too

@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn’t have same safety criticality as crew.

The Republican lead in North Carolina almost doubled from yesterday!

@krassenstein @neuralink Early stage, yes, but only limited help is possible for late stage Alzheimer’s, as there there is too much neuronal loss
This hoax was repeated by Kamala in the debate with Trump even though she knows it’s a hoax

Most important message of the night is to get everyone you know to vote and vote now!

There is always some chance of a work or personal emergency or some external factor on Nov 5th that prevents people from voting.
And give responsibility for streamlining legal immigration management to a competent company, as the bureaucracy is utterly broken. 

It is literally easier for a serial killer to get into America than a Nobel Prize winner!
@ajtourville Bill Maher still can’t believe the magnitude of the illegal voter importation program under Biden-Harris even though the data is unequivocal. 

There have been high triple digit increases in illegals in all swing states over the course of only three years!! That’s insane!!

Losing the election is making them desperate.
@DavidSacks They are. 

Dems are now over 300k votes behind where they were in Pennsylvania in 2020, when the margin of victory was only 80k.

Cooked.
But all the legacy (formerly “mainstream”) media said there was no fraud. 

They lied.

@pmarca Yeah
@Thompsonklay @stillgray The Dems are in favor of importing voters who are beholden to them and against allowing legal immigrants who would probably vote against them. 

Simple matter of incentives.
@tsarnick Fate does love irony.

Big numbers
@tunguz He is just plain wrong. Almost the entire founding team of @SpaceX was over 30. 

Over half of the founding team of Tesla was too.
@shellenberger Until about a month ago, early voting in 2024 favored the Dems even more than 2020. 

Leading Dems told me with extreme confidence that they would win Pennsylvania. They were certain.

Then there were some anomalies in the matrix and now Republican early votes vastly exceed 2020.

The Dems have imported massive numbers of illegals to swing states. Triple digit increases over the past 4 years!

Their STATED plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible, turning all swing states Dem.

@Rob_2628 Wow. The return on investment for the final Paragon Points is rough 😂
The Atlantic is an evil publication
If given 4 more years to do it, the big govt machine will legalize vast numbers of illegals, making all swing states permanently deep blue, just like they did with California.

Every major Democrat politician has stated that their goal is to legalize all illegals. Believe them.
If they are able to do this, there will be no swing states next election
@AlecStapp It’s not that hard and China will succeed. 

Paperwork is the biggest issue.
Our system is broken
Those against voter ID in America are the ones who want to commit election fraud
@stclairashley Exactly
This is a crisis
A common story. 

So many people I know have been assaulted on the street or had their homes or cars robbed. Out of dozens of stories, there was not one where the criminals were sent to prison. Not one. Zero.

Enough is enough.

This violates US criminal statutes against foreign interference in elections. 

We are going after CCDH and their donors.

@AutismCapital DJT has the constitution of an ox. Very impressive.
@AmericanRebble Exactly
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Cool
@Kristennetten @iam_smx Yeah
@tunguz You mean in terms of what AI can do?
Democrats greatly outspend Republicans, have 90% of legacy media &amp; online media on their side, 90% of Hollywood celebs and a massive number of organizers on the ground. 

Frankly, it’s surprising that Republicans win at all!
@AutismCapital They know they’re gonna lose
@eyeslasho That’s a big difference!
The margin of the Biden PA win in 2020 was ~80k votes. Just based on the early vote delta, Pennsylvania will go Republican in 2024, but we cannot be complacent. 

Drag your friends &amp; family to vote now!
@AutismCapital Nobody cares about puppets of the machine
Drag 10 friends to vote!
@WesternLensman You’re gonna lose, @Tim_Walz 🤡 

Saving the American people from the torture of hearing you speak for 4 years was worth it 😂
Two weeks ago, the early vote delta in Pennsylvania for 2024 was worse for Republicans than 2020. It is now dramatically better.

@FutureJurvetson These were done in spite of, not because of, the California government. It would be far lower cost to manufacture in other states, which is why our competitors moved out of state.

That was because I lived in California.
@FutureJurvetson Boeing and Lockheed moved their rocket production from California to Alabama. 

SpaceX took over an abandoned aerospace building in LA County and turned it into the highest volume rocket producer in the world. 

That was because I lived in California.
@FutureJurvetson The last automotive factory in California (NUMMI) shut down in early 2009. 

Tesla took over the derelict building, after it was stripped of anything useful, and it is now the highest production car factory in the Americas!

That was simply because I lived in California.

If there is not radical reduction of government expenditures, then, just like an individual who has taken on too much debt, America will become de facto bankrupt. 

The interest on the debt is trending to rapidly absorb all tax revenue, leaving nothing for critical needs.

No judge is greater than the consensus will of the people.
If given another four years, the Dem machine will legalize so many illegals that there will be no swing states. 

This is what they did in California, which is now a supermajority Dem one-party state.

@CommunityNotes
What Walz is saying is utterly false. 

In fact, @realDonaldTrump recently posted that he would VETO a nationwide abortion ban!

https://t.co/QdXkYQWQ1X
@MaryTilesTexas Yeah
@WesternLensman What a nut 🤣
Love is the answer 🥰
Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
Join us!
@FCC Thanks for expediting this approval
Sign our petition to support the Constitution!

Also earn $47 for every person you refer to sign the petition if they’re in a swing state. 

Goal is to get 1M voters in swing states to show support for free speech &amp; right to bear arms.
Exactly
@MarioNawfal @CathieDWood True
@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
@Rob_2628 Spiritborn everywhere 😂

Yup, sounds familiar. 

People have been so thorough my brainwashed by the legacy media.
Definitely not

Bring. It. On.
Low bar tbh. Unlike the border, we actually check IDs for the event 🤣🤣
@TheRabbitHole84 It’s tragic that a science magazine has become an anti-science political shill propaganda rag

@teslaownersSV I was about this meme tbh 😂
@CollinRugg Yeah … news flash, Hilary, you’re not supposed to HAVE total control!!
I’m hearing this anti free speech bs being parroted by pretty much every leading Dem &amp; their legacy media puppets
@tsarnick True … sigh
This is so crazy
Incredible crowd today at the rally in Pennsylvania https://t.co/pamx8yAMd8
Make sure everyone you know has registered to vote! Only 2 days left to do so in Georgia &amp; Arizona. https://t.co/QDrxjHQjXG
True
@cb_doge Yeah
@SERobinsonJr That was an amazing rally!
@cb_doge And they insisted on vaccine ID to travel anywhere, but also insist on no ID to vote!

Something very rotten about that.
@mayemusk It’s a different world if someone only reads legacy media propaganda

@ForgiatoBlow47 Cool kid
Make America Based Again!
@TeslaBoomerMama “We lose total control” implies that they have almost total control already, which seems true based on how the legacy media all mysteriously have the exact same talking points at the exact same time. 

The media all said Biden was “sharp as a tack” right before the debate where
@ScottPresler Great!
@SaysSimonson He’s shopping for fancy clothes while people are suffering from hurricane damage. This is some Hunger Games shit.

@RichardHanania The anti baby propaganda is powerful
@shaunmmaguire @america Thanks!
@JTLonsdale They’re literally on camera saying the exact opposite thing and treating the public like fools!
That’s how easy it is to turn on Starlink!

Works anywhere 5 minutes after you take it out of the box.
Those against freedom of speech are the bad guys!
If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t win, the “Democratic” Party will legalize so many illegals that there will be no swing states!

America will become a single-party socialist state, just like what happened to California, where they just made requiring voter ID illegal.
Almost 10 million people watching!
 https://t.co/qg31Yb8zhZ
You’re most welcome!
This is the most important election of your LIFE!!

And there are only 2 days left to register to vote in Arizona &amp; Georgia before it’s too late!

Make sure everyone you know &amp; everyone you meet has registered to vote. The fate of our civilization is at stake.
Anyone else seeing this sort of thing?

Not right
Exactly, the whole country will be like California politically, which is a one-party state
Racism in any form is abhorrent and those who push it should be shunned
To paraphrase Milton Friedman: the worst results come from people spending other people’s money on a different group of other people. That is the government!
216,000 voters on the list in Arizona in violation of the law
@stillgray Exactly
Read the America PAC website to understand why I support @realDonaldTrump
Headed to Pennsylvania to speak at the @realDonaldTrump rally in Butler!
If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t win, the Democrats will have 4 years to turn swing states in permanent deep blue states
Register to vote in Arizona. Only 2 days left!
The Democratic Party is openly stating that they want to change the Constitution to end free speech!
@nima_owji @XGaming Cool
@AlexBerenson Seriously, who is running the country?
@HSajwanization @FAANews Yeah!!
Action is being taken to stop fraudulent voting in Arizona
Exactly
So true 🤣🤣
@ajtourville Doesn’t seem like SpaceX and ULA are being treated equally before the law
@IterIntellectus Sounds great!
@BasedBeffJezos Yeah
@GadSaad @JoeBiden @SpeakerPelosi @KamalaHarris Wow, that is next-level bad 😳
@GadSaad Insane that someone could advocate racial genocide and not be ostracized!

She should be completely shunned from society.
Super important to get all your friends and family to register to vote. 

Georgia’s registration deadline is Monday!!
The same people who demanded you must have a vaccine ID to travel are demanding no ID to vote!
@StephenKing Vote for @realDonaldTrump to save democracy!!
@stillgray @FAANews They might be thirsty 🤷‍♂️
@ZubyMusic Indeed 😔
If there is a Democratic Party victory this election, they will ban voter ID requirements nationwide, enabling massive voter fraud.

Banning voter ID is their stated goal – they are not hiding it!

After that, your vote won’t matter, so this is therefore the last real election.
The term “far right” has been watered down so much by the legacy media as to render the term meaningless by historical standards, which is a terrible thing for them to do
Just offering @FAANews some tea 🤣🤣
California passed a law last week that made it ILLEGAL to ask for ID in elections!

Literally impossible to prove fraud there now. https://t.co/QAOhO6ajfr

@SecretaryPete Still waiting … the helicopter is trying to land to deliver critical supplies. What’s the number to call?
@nima_owji Good idea
What the hell
@SecretaryPete Are you saying this man and hundreds of others are all lying?
@SecretaryPete There are hundreds of reports of FEMA/FAA blocking flights. This literally just happened. 

I will follow you. Please DM me the number to call.
@ValentinaForUSA @fema Yeah, it’s not just SpaceX. They won’t let anyone help!
@nichegamer Tencent has made many smart moves. Impressive execution.
@twatterbaas South Africa is such a beautiful country
SpaceX engineers are trying to deliver Starlink terminals &amp; supplies to devastated areas in North Carolina right now and @FEMA is both failing to help AND won’t let others help. This is unconscionable!!

@iamyesyouareno This is bizarre and super racist of them
@elon_docs 💯

We are seeing this right now with FEMA. 

They stated on their website that DEI was their top priority!
Unless Trump wins and we get rid of the mountain of smothering regulations (that have nothing to do with safety!), humanity will never reach Mars. 

This is existential.
Starlink connectivity directly from our satellites to mobile phones will be profoundly important and save many lives when there are natural or human-driven disasters
One could perhaps debate whether this is deliberate or accidental, but not that it is occurring. 

The migrant settlement numbers and locations come from US government data under a Democratic administration!
@ajtourville @xai Worth noting that @xAI has been and will open source its models, including weights and everything, 

As we create the next version, we open source the prior version, as we did with Grok 1 when Grok 2 was released.
Just received this note from a SpaceX engineer helping on the ground in North Carolina. 

@FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, but is actively blocking citizens who try to help!

@BasedBeffJezos True
Yes, they are literally using YOUR tax dollars to import voters and disenfranchise you!  

It is happening right in front of your eyes. 

And FEMA used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives. Treason.
If I bring up Trump in LA, people react like they got shot with a dart containing rabies and crystal meth 😂
Is this for real?

It takes 5 years to go from permanent residency to citizenship or just 3 years via marriage.

@alx If they’re all made legal, then there will be no illegals! Problem solved 😂
As a reminder, I am very much in favor of expedited legal immigration for anyone who is talented, hardworking and honest.

America should be like a pro sports team that wants to win the championship – draft the best players to enable the whole team to win!
@cb_doge Yeah!
The Kamala Dem machine wants to legalize all illegals, which would turn all swing state blue immediately and ensure permanent one-party rule in America!
It’s only a matter of time before the illegals in the swing states are legally able to vote. If it were up to leading Dems, they would be allowed to vote right now!

Here is Schumer saying exactly that: https://t.co/eSd8bma8Aq
@BillAckman @POTUS @KamalaHarris @DNC Doesn’t it seem strange that Biden, nominally the Commander in Chief of the United States, had to make a groveling apology for accidentally calling illegals ‘illegals’ during his speech to Congress?

The word “undocumented” is such a bullshit word! Makes
@BillAckman @POTUS @KamalaHarris @DNC One can certainly debate whether this is a deliberate strategy by the Democrats, but not that there are massive, triple digit increases in migrants to swing states. That is an unequivocal fact. 

It is also a fact that illegals vote overwhelmingly Democrat when legalized, as

@TeslaBoomerMama Not any one person, as far as I know. There is the Soros bogeyman, of course, and various Dem leaders, but no single mastermind. 

It seems to be a simple matter of incentives: the more illegals imported, the higher the Dem vote over time. It will only backfire on the Dems if
@shaunmmaguire True 😔
@hyhieu226 @grok We need the Grok Doc!
The Dems are doing deliberate voter importation to swing states &amp; fast-tracking them to citizenship.

The only question is when (not if) enough migrants can vote to flip all swing states, shifting the whole country to permanent one-party rule, just like what happened to

Mind-blowing that the Democratic Party is massively outspending the Republican Party in swing states!

The Democrats have become the party of the rich and entitled (just look at their donor list) and the Republicans have become the party of the people.
@BehizyTweets Crazy

Worth posting again lol https://t.co/hRbz89kWNB
@stclairashley Literally! Your average library has more identity verification than California requires for voting. 

I wonder why 🤔
Since the Hurricane Helene disaster, SpaceX has sent as many Starlink terminals as possible to help areas in need.

Earlier today, @realDonaldTrump alerted me to additional people who need Starlink Internet in North Carolina. We are sending them terminals right away.

@unlimited_ls This is why Tesla vehicle have automatic overheat protection to safeguard kids &amp; pets
@MarioNawfal Yeah
@BasedMikeLee The truth is somewhere in the middle.

Climate change risk is overstated in the near-term, but probably accurate in the long-term.

All that matters is how many billions of tons of carbon are transferred from deep underground into the atmosphere and oceans, aka the “surface
The law is violating the law
Accurate
@JamesMelville This is silly. Leave the farmers alone! It won’t matter for climate change.
@JonErlichman Absolutely the right attitude.

@waitbutwhy I’m worried about de facto bias in “the Twitter algorithm” having a major effect on public discourse. 

How do we know what’s really happening?
@Rainmaker1973 True. And even a 10% reduction in g would make reaching orbit relatively easy.
@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines, as they are much more capable &amp; reliable. 230 ton or ~500k lb thrust at sea level.

We’ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test.
@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%, so not a major change. Those numbers don’t count Starship.

Rough math is ~16 tons * 50 launches = 800 tons. Rest of world is &lt;400 tons (mostly China).

@mgsiegler Absolutely
@teslaownersSV @PaperBagInvest True. That was mega pain.
@PaperBagInvest But reaching volume production with sustained positive cash flow was last achieved by an American car company, Chrysler, ~100 years ago!

Ford &amp; Tesla are the only American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009.
@PaperBagInvest Prototypes are easy, production is hard. 

Making an electric car was not the hard part of Tesla – dozens of companies have done that.
@MrManderly @mysteriouskat @Independent @rustyrockets Good point. Politicians &amp; political parties should be supported on their merits, not like they are one’s favorite sports team.
@Independent With so many mainstream media companies saying @rustyrockets is crazy/dangerous, I watched some of his videos. Ironically, he seemed more balanced &amp; insightful than those condemning him!

The groupthink among major media companies is more troubling. There should be more dissent.

@pmarca Yeah
@engineers_feed Hardcore
@WholeMarsBlog They have no idea how hard FSD is. Only path to success imo is hardcore real-world AI software with dedicated NN inference acceleration ASICs in car, multibillion dollar NN training supercluster and 10+ billion miles of vehicle data. Good luck.
Thank you for the offer, but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage.

@saylor As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high.

@saylor It is not entirely unpredictable that you would reach that conclusion

@FedorovMykhailo @OMarkarova You’re welcome. We have also sent power adapters for car cigarette lighters, solar/battery packs and generators for places where electricity is not available.
@PPathole @SpaceX Optimized, fully-reusable Starship is ~150t to same reference orbit as Saturn V. In expendable mode, Starship payload would be 250t to 300t.
@Erdayastronaut @CopSub In our experience, COPV gain/pain flattens out above 6000 psi and is &lt;1 above 10,000 psi, unless volume constrained like Dragon. 

Heating from pressurization &amp; cooling from depressurization also become major problems at very high pressure.
@Kristennetten @BBCScienceNews There is no direct evidence of that ad being run, but that does sum up the sales pitch. It is mind-blowing that he &amp; his crew *rowed* to a whaling station from the Antarctic!

For those who (mistakenly) think this is a radiation risk, pick what you think is the worst location. I will travel there &amp; eat locally grown food on TV.

I did this in Japan many years ago, shortly after Fukushima. Radiation risk is much, much lower than most people believe.
Hopefully, it is now extremely obvious that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones. 

This is *critical* to national and international security.

No point in doing so until passing that threshold.
@ChristianWalk1r Increased oil &amp; gas production in the short term is critical or people around the world will be placed under great duress. 

This is not a question of money, it is a question of having enough energy to power civilization.

@SpacePadreIsle Some Starlink terminals near conflict areas were being jammed for several hours at a time. Our latest software update bypasses the jamming.

Am curious to see what’s next!
@RogerYar All news sources are partially propaganda, some more than others
Starlink has been told by some governments (not Ukraine) to block Russian news sources. We will not do so unless at gunpoint.

Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.
SpaceX reprioritized to cyber defense &amp; overcoming signal jamming. 

Will cause slight delays in Starship &amp; Starlink V2.
@MichaelTChiass1 @Cole00708909 Who, me? 🙄
@GailAlfarATX Exactly
And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia, who do not want this
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 Hold Strong Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil &amp; gas exports.
Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil &amp; gas output immediately. 

Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.
@RenataKonkoly @MLUKBrandenburg @gigafactory_4 @Gf4Tesla @Gruenheide4futr @Stk_Brandenburg Haha sure :)
@teslaownersSV @tobyliiiiiiiiii Game on
@tobyliiiiiiiiii Almost all Viasat Ukraine user terminals were rendered permanently unusable by a Russian cyberattack on day of invasion, so … yes
@shortword @eddyiskongz Yes, provided no metal particles in paint
@eddyiskongz Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection
@eddyiskongz Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible
Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge In class action lawsuits, the actual plaintiff is always the class action law firm. They just find someone willing to serve as a puppet to “represent the class”.
@FedorovMykhailo @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @Honda @ChampionGen @westinghouse @DuroMaxPower Updating software to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter.

@ICannot_Enough @genesimmons @JoeBiden By the way, Tesla factory worker compensation is the highest in the auto industry https://t.co/Peo3qtYc5D
@ICannot_Enough @genesimmons @JoeBiden Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment, so if we don’t treat and compensate our (awesome) people well, they have many other offers and will just leave!

I’d like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them.
@genesimmons @JoeBiden Actually, we still operate our California factory, which is the largest auto plant in North America, at full capacity and are considering expanding it significantly.

It has built 2/3 of all electric vehicles in North America, twice as much as all other carmakers combined.
@katlinegrey @Rogozin Ukraine civilian Internet was experiencing strange outages – bad weather perhaps? – so SpaceX is helping fix it
@FedorovMykhailo @Brian_J_Berger @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @Honda @ChampionGen @westinghouse @DuroMaxPower @W__Home Solar area will need to be higher with obscuration, but works better than one might think
@WholeMarsBlog We could’ve made a 600 mile Model S 12 months ago, but that would’ve made the product worse imo, as 99.9% of time you’d be carrying unneeded battery mass, which makes acceleration, handling &amp; efficiency worse. Even our 400+ mile range car is more than almost anyone will use.
@teslaownersSV 🤣🤣 That was me tweeting from @SpaceX when someone else had snatched my name. 

I was actually one of the earliest Twitter users, but dropped my account because people were tweeting such trivialities at first. @westcoastbill convinced me to get back in.
@WholeMarsBlog The probability of Tesla dying in 2008/2009 was very high. We closed our financing round at 6pm on Dec 24th – the last working hour of the last day before Tesla would otherwise bounce payroll.
@JasonDanheiser @WholeMarsBlog @28delayslater Self-driving cars &amp; useful humanoid robots require a sophisticated understanding of reality. I am increasingly convinced that they are on the path to solving AGI.

@WholeMarsBlog @moneymik3420 @jack @gdb Yeah, definitely don’t use C unless optimizing for hardware performance!
@jack @gdb I’m a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it.

For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.

Otherwise, we mostly use C++ &amp; Python.
@Kristennetten While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the “hard one”, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too.

An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Can’t just jam GPUs in the trunk.
@tesletter @Kristennetten Definitely
@Kristennetten A general solution to self-driving (essentially, real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training, inference, control, analytical tools, data management, hardware optimization &amp; simulation.

One of the hardest technology problems that exists.
@gdb Compilers can be way better too. Not enough effort spent there.
@TalbottRicky Sorry!

Most news outlets attempt to answer the question: “What are the worst things happening on Earth today?”

It’s a big planet! Obviously, some bad things are happening somewhere at any given time, but focusing relentlessly on those does not give an accurate picture of reality.
@GailAlfarATX So hard to find out what’s going on in the world without being bombarded with news that makes one sad &amp; angry!
@GuiStroz @JohnnaCrider1 True, careless negativity (destruction) is much harder than thoughtful positivity (creation)
@stevenmarkryan Sadly true
@JohnnaCrider1 That’s true to some degree, but citizen podcasts that aren’t negative like Rogan, Fridman, Dodd, TED interviews, etc are very popular. 

Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard? They so rarely even try to be positive.
@slashdot Not needed
Why is the “traditional” media such a relentless hatestream? Real question.

@SirineAti Starship is in a different league. Orders of magnitude more mass to orbit than Falcon. Necessary for creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.
If things go well, Falcon will launch about once a week on average in 2022, delivering ~2/3 of all Earth payload to orbit
@GailAlfarATX @Tesla Tesla is working hard to provide more Megapacks for grid stabilization

@teslaownersSV Exactly. The terminology is anachronistic.
@pmarca Who controls the memes,

SpaceX standard antenna production rises rapidly this year, so those with orders shouldn’t have to wait long.

@karpathy “Prompt engineering” is natural language programming
@DavidSacks Natural human tendency is to want to negotiate when you think you’re losing, rather than when you think you’re winning.

@TitterDaily Of course. 

To mitigate this, we are also tightening limits on how much data can be downloaded per account, especially new accounts.
@TimSweeneyEpic 1. Scraping is already disallowed by T&amp;C.

@iliketeslas @jurgen_nauditt Exactly!

To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals.

I am simply stating that, without Starlink, the Ukrainian lines would collapse, as the Russians can jam all other communications!

We would never
Farmers deserve our respect &amp; admiration!
@GuntherEagleman @libsoftiktok As do the elite in Ukraine and some of the elite in the West, all of whom have fancy dinners in mansions every night, while sending the sons of others to die in trenches of mud and blood in the forever war
@GuntherEagleman The Democrats pay off some of the Republicans with a piece of the action
Men die in trenches every day, while politicians &amp; warmongers eat gourmet meals
@sikorskiradek Be quiet, small man. 

You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. 

And there is no substitute for Starlink.

@AdamLowisz I literally challenged Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off. 

What I am sickened by is years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will
Place sanctions on the top 10 Ukrainian oligarchs, especially the ones with mansions in Monaco, and this will stop immediately. 

That is the key to the puzzle.

@EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Unless I’m missing something, Russia is showing no signs of withdrawing.

On the other hand, the idea that Russia can roll over areas of Ukraine (or other countries) that are not mostly Russian-speaking is also false.

@ggreenwald Don’t want to blow their minds, but there is a slight possibility that not everything is Russian disinformation
@UpdatingOnRome I sometimes wonder if perhaps Rome was started by exiles from Troy. It’s not completely out of the question. 

At some point in antiquity, a few ships of very competent soldiers (with almost no women) landed on the coast of Italy. Where did they come from?

@taylorswift13 I recommend posting some music or concert videos directly on the X platform
@alx No other way to describe it. 

Meanwhile, many actual crimes, some of great significance, go not merely unpunished, but not even investigated.

Something is rotten.
Strange that there is almost no legacy media coverage of this.

About 2 million people – from every country on Earth – are entering through the US southern border every year.

The number is rising rapidly, yet no preventive action is taken by the current administration.

@anduriltech Prototypes are easy, production is hard.

Any given conflict comes down to number of combat units times kill ratio. 

US military vulnerability is primarily due to slow production rates, as we’re seeing in Ukraine.

The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor.

If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and
@MarioNawfal Both sides should agree to a truce. 

Every day that passes, more Ukrainian and Russian youth die to gain and lose small pieces of land, with borders barely changing. This is not worth their lives.

@teslaownersSV @DrKnowItAll16 @alx Advertisers avoid controversy, so all that is needed for ADL to crush our US &amp; European ad revenue is to make unfounded accusations. They have much less power in Asia, so our ad revenue there is still strong.

@libsoftiktok That’s for sure. 

Might take until next week, as we’re short-staffed this week.
@WholeMarsBlog True
@cb_doge That’s the goal
@DrKnowItAll16 @alx Based on what we’ve heard from advertisers, ADL seems to be responsible for most of our revenue loss. 

Giving them maximum benefit of the doubt, I don’t see any scenario where they’re responsible for less than 10% of the value destruction, so ~$4 billion.

@cb_doge @ADL Yeah
@MarioNawfal Exactly
@KeithWoodsYT In general, permanent bans will be rare going forward. That is necessary for this platform to be the public square. 

I also agree that the ADL should make their explicit demands public. In my opinion, they are excessive, but perhaps the public will agree with them.
@ID_AA_Carmack It is oddly hard to figure out where the beep is coming from

@WholeMarsBlog Density is only 3 to 4 per rack, due to power consumption &amp; cooling needs being much higher than normal computers. H100 density is only ~2 per rack!
@Rainmaker1973 Beautiful
Very interesting. Hungary is trying hard to address their birth rate problem.
@garrytan Who appoints the members?
@webflite 747. I wish Boeing still made that plane.

My understanding is that the 747-8i can cruise at Mach 0.92, which makes it the fastest jumbo jet.

747 has achieved Mach 0.99, so almost supersonic in a dive.
@garrytan Great!
@mayemusk I was wondering why you never told me about the ad 😂
@Jim_Jordan Justice does not thrive in the dark

@X___PB @TimSweeneyEpic I’m guessing that the single largest use of that power is making the cursor blink
@TimSweeneyEpic But let’s say you had a choice between large size or small, which would you pick?
@INTERIORPORN1 Throw some sounds of groaning metal support beams failing to spice it up

I liked Cyberpunk. 

Baldur’s Gate 3 is supposed to be great.
@lexfridman Some dark moments
@gdb So I’m guess ordering a zillion GPUs last year has panned out?
@TrungTPhan I love Heinz Ketchup. It’s the best.
@Rainmaker1973 The desire to have wet roads causes sprinklers to be built to rain water upon the roads. 

In short, wet roads cause rain.

@CaizerEduard @Scobleizer We’re going with both Dojo and Nvidia. I think we will have the most inference silicon, given that every car has an inference computer.
@alx Perhaps he is “traveling” a great distance
@mrexits This guy rocks!
@garrytan That we pay them to do this is annoying. How do we stop this self-licking ice cream cone!?
@ray4tesla Did my best to warn people that LiDAR isn’t optimal for cars. Roads are designed for biological neural nets &amp; eyes, so digital neural nets &amp; cameras will work best.

I say this even though Dragon uses LiDAR for docking with Station, so I don’t intrinsically hate that technology.
@ray4tesla Some of them are indeed doing so – we’re well aware.

Part of the value of having our own hardware is that our software will only run on that specific hardware, warts &amp; all.

As with Apple, you can’t just copy the code or unpack the binaries. You need their hardware too.
@garrytan Best to ignore the trolls
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@AsTheWorldBurnz @Cernovich He should get it imo
@DirtyTesLa It’s a real 6 months. Maybe less.
@JonErlichman Not bad
@mualphaxi @SpaceX It’s insane
Dragon docks with @Space_Station.

Strange to think that they’re both traveling at ~25 times speed of sound!
@garrytan @kevinvdahlgren True
@farzyness Having a vast fleet of cars for FSD Autopilot training is a massive Tesla advantage. Essential for the hundreds of millions of unusual situations cars encounter on roads every year.
@WholeMarsBlog HW4 software will lag HW3 by at least another six months, as our focus needs to be on getting FSD on HW3 working super well and provided internationally.
@WholeMarsBlog Designing in the cameras, liquid-cooled Tesla computer (always go liquid-cooled!) and high security internet gateway will probably take major car companies about three years.

Might as well start now! We want to be helpful, as we were with making our patents available for free,
@ianzelbo People send me LinkedIn links sometimes, but the cringe level is so high that I just can’t bring myself to use it, so I ask for the resume or bio to be emailed.

We will make sure that the X competitor to LinkedIn is cool.
@DrAseemMalhotra On balance, we are far better to have modern medicine than not, but there have been some egregious situations, like opioids.

Some of my friends were seriously hurt by this and are now lost to the world.

No question that we need to have stronger accountability.
@aelluswamy True, it was super hard to do this!

Even when FSD is 2X as safe as the average human driver fully unsupervised in all scenarios, then we will want to make it 3X, 4X … 10X.

About a million people die every year in automotive accidents and ~10 million are seriously injured.

@LibertyCappy Great idea 😂
@WholeMarsBlog There is a lot of merit to having your own chip design. We optimize its usage down to the microsecond.
@Teslaconomics It is very easy!

11.4.7, which is mostly, but not entirely, AI is with Tesla employees and a few external users. Rolls out to anyone who bought FSD in the North America next week.

@micsolana Yeah
@durreadan01 The use efficiency (single tap vs scroll up plus tap) exceeds the esthetic penalty. However, I think we should make each button separate, like the post (+) button, rather than have a translucent bar.
@mezaoptimizer Not that it’s much consolation, but the energy efficiency of LLMs using auto-regressive transformers is extremely bad, not just in training, but also inference.

I think it’s off by several orders of magnitude.
Starlink antennas use an internally developed, electronically steered phased array tight beam that is more advanced than the best military technology

The Crew-7 mission for @NASA is in orbit, on its way to @Space_Station!
@alexchaomander @Scobleizer In my opinion, one  and it isn’t LLM’s using auto-regressive transformers
@Scobleizer An accurate assessment.

What is also mindblowing is that the inference compute power needed for 8 cameras running at 36FPS is only about 100W on the Tesla-designed AI computer. This puny amount of power is enough to achieve superhuman driving!

It makes a big difference that we

@JTLonsdale The weaponization of government agencies needs to stop. This fundamentally undermines public faith in the justice system.
@gurgavin The fundamental principle of ITAR law is that US companies who have advanced weapons technology, such as rockets with intercontinental range, must hire people who are permanent American residents, so that the technology does not fall into the hands of countries who wish us harm.

@DanielleFong @jimkxa At the end the day, we just need resilient logic gates, so maybe there is a way to get 1000x volumetrically?
@jimkxa @DanielleFong Can you elaborate on how to achieve 1000x? At this point, we should just count the atoms, rather than say “2nm”. 

Obviously, 2nm is just a marketing term, not the actual metal width, which is more like 20nm.

But 1000x would still be smaller than the size of a carbon atom, if
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Wow, 4 years
@McGradyCyber Exactly

@Newsthink Good for India 🇮🇳!
@cb_doge User-seconds is the most rigorous measure of usage
@cb_doge Great question. We need to get a move on with Starship!

Surprised to see that Mashable still exists.
@garrytan What does the @ACLU say about this?
@DrKnowItAll16 Do video games or movies have time? They just have frames. 

When those frames are shown at human comprehension speed, they appear to be continuous, but they are not. 

The reality that we are in is bounded by Planck-time.

@PrinceVogel One of the things that surprised me most was how many people simply read this platform and never post or like. 

They may DM, bookmark or forward a post, but are reticent to do anything public.

The ratio is shockingly high, as you point out. I hope more people participate.
@krassenstein Yes, the obvious move is to strengthen the mute function by making anything posted by the muted account invisible to you. Right now, both mute and block are partly broken.

It should also be made easy to continue to follow an account, while blocking their ability to DM you.
@spacesudoer @TeslaSynopsis @teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU @dvorahfr @Kristennetten @imPenny2x @JaneidyEve @SirineAti @kerrikgray That BBC reporter obviously had no idea what he was saying, but someone told him to make those false claims. 

The question is who.
@cb_doge Pretty much
@Culture_Crit Strange that everyone except small children was expected to wear a hat
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@imPenny2x Weaponize apathy and see if anyone cares
@EdKrassen Mute needs to mute properly, including all mentions. Block will only apply to DMs. @Jack gets it. Surprisingly few others do.
@adamdangelo True. I hope it’s nice to us humans.
Pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away. 

How does the medicine taste? 😂😂

@Teslaconomics Next week
@imPenny2x @tblckn Good one
@boomer_rube @stclairashley Proctology exam?
@ElMcBoBo @Teslaconomics Lmaooo
@Teslaconomics “Traveling” with Zuckerberg
@RampCapitalLLC Great idea
@stclairashley @stillgray Farmception
@karpathy @yacineMTB @finbarrtimbers A100s already seem so quaint
@NFT_GOD I mostly agree with your recommendations. Much is already in flight. 

Let’s circle back in a month and see what’s still missing.
@cb_doge Real science is welcome, pseudoscience will get community noted
@krassenstein Good grief
@cb_doge @lexfridman We got some cupcakes for Lex’s birthday
@BasedBeffJezos And it’s made of cake. Always has been.
Fight Recap:

I joked on X about fighting Zuck

Zuck then said “SEND ME LOCATION” 

Italy graciously offered a Colosseum

Zuck declined

I suggested his home as “safe space”

Tragically, he was ahem “traveling”

Is there anywhere he will fight?

 https://t.co/gpcRLW49fv
@alx Ask about his opinion on poultry
@WalterIsaacson That is the biggest question
@john Cool
@CathieDWood Interesting
@tibo_maker Anything you think you should change?
@xDaily Accurate
@alx I can’t tell what’s real these day 😂

Can someone please let him know on 🧵that I’m popping by his house to fight as soon as he’s “back in town”.
@dogeofficialceo Toffee Crisp 😋
@krassenstein Yeah.

Also, civil war isn’t very civil.
@PicturesFoIder Mosquitoes that carry malaria
@eldsjal 6 hours works for me. Less than that and my brain is in pain
@bassel_amin @cb_doge I care very much
@WholeMarsBlog I wonder why
@GailAlfarATX True
@Scobleizer When we properly apply AI to X, the content recommendations, about AI and everything else, will be incredible
@xDaily The cracks &amp; scratches better represent this product that I love
@andst7 Accurate
@cb_doge Exactly 😂😂
@WholeMarsBlog That how humans work. It’s rather obvious, imo, that you need real-world AI (digital neural nets) and cameras to solve for a road system that is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
@cb_doge He would have to let that sink in!
@cb_doge There was some hasty bag packing at the  Zuckerberg residence today! Traveling my ass.
(Zuck thread coming soon about how he would of course love to fight anytime, but blah blah UFC something something)
@ashleevance A lot 🤣
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla FSD test, X Livestream test &amp; attempted Zuck fight triple header!!!
@dogeofficialceo Hey @growing_daniel, no offense, but is that you?
@GailAlfarATX I barely ever read them. 

Mainstream media is a misery magnifier.
For the Tesla FSD test drive in Palo Alto tonight, I will ask the car to drive to @finkd’s house.

Will also test latest X livestream video, so you can monitor our adventure in real-time!

If we get lucky and Zuck my 👅 actually answers the door, the fight is on!
@dogeofficialceo Knock knock
Who’s there?
Knutsēk
Nutsack who?
Knutsēk Tæbag
Thought you might want some tea, so I brought the bags
Knock, knock … challenge accepted … open the door @finkd
@paulg Yeah
@lexfridman Elden Ring if solo, Diablo if co-op. Haven’t played BG3, but heard it’s great.
@tszzl Need to finish the job
The die is cast https://t.co/QNcefBA8EO
@cb_doge Yeah
@alx Can’t wait to bang on his door tomorrow 🤣
@TheBronxViking @unusual_whales Love that movie
@WholeMarsBlog He can’t eat at chic fil a because that would be cannibalism
@xDaily I’m gonna bang on his door tomorrow and demand to fight
@stclairashley Zuck is a chicken
@cb_doge @WalterIsaacson This is the full message: https://t.co/UzbKoIkFOc
@DavidSacks @AMercouris Accurate
@dogeofficialceo Never 👀
@powerbottomdad1 California has a lot going for it
@teslaownersSV Such a great country and people!
@GRDecter Yikes
@farzyness They really are
@baldursgate3 Heard good things
@WholeMarsBlog @bindureddy Tell me about it
@mipateluk @tunguz DNA GitHub
@WholeMarsBlog People in SF are having sex?
Practicing martial arts with my sparring partner https://t.co/bifsH2Mejs
@OwenSparks_ Art too incredible for words
@xDaily Or we could do both and consider next week just a practice session
@xDaily Otherwise, we will do it as soon as the arena in Italy is ready
@xDaily If Zuck my 👅 really wants a lesson in why there are weight categories in fighting so badly, I could just head over to his house next week and teach him a lesson he won’t soon forget
@MatthewDR @Tesla Tesla shorts sure are gluttons for punishment! I mean, how many times do they want to do this!?
@ggcollignon 🇲🇽 Mexico rocks! 🇲🇽
And pediatric hospitals in Italy
@shellenberger Awesome!
@WholeMarsBlog Been lifting hard almost every day. Need to be able to do an overhead press of ~155lbs …
@stillgray @ACOLExyz @cb_doge I’m going for the @WWE overhead body slam smack down
@ACOLExyz @cb_doge If the size difference is big enough, this is absolutely true. No way lil X is putting me in a choke hold no matter how skilled he is lol.
@VivekGRamaswamy Who did the poll?
@garrytan Absolutely
Our goal is to make this the best platform for creators around the world!
@MarcusHouse Falcon 9 looks cute next to Starship and Falcon 1 looks like a high school project
@stclairashley I love the night
@monitoringbias In fairness, he does demonstrate that people of any race can be extremely stupid

@cremieuxrecueil Yeah
@tunguz Yeah
Estne volumen in toga, an solum tibi libet me videre?
@cb_doge Both video &amp; just audio
@DustinStockton Are you sure?
@cb_doge Yup, and across iOS, Android, Windows, Linux &amp; Mac
@jimfarley98 @LivShaka It is a great community
And all proceeds go to veterans
@cb_doge I spent 3 hours in an MRI machine on Monday. Bottom line is that my C5/C6 fusion is solid, so not an issue. 

However, there is a problem with my right shoulder blade rubbing against my ribs, which requires minor surgery. Recovery will only take a few months.
Everything done will pay respect to the past and present of Italy
@growing_daniel Can we at least know how they will spend American tax dollars? 

I don’t mind some corruption, but it would be nice to know roughly how many pennies on the dollar are making it to the average person in Ukraine.
@EvaFoxU @lindayaX I’m working on engineering, design &amp; server operations, which is what I like to do
@dogeofficialceo This is the funniest place on the Internet!
@krassenstein Absolutely!
@TheChiefNerd Technically, lawful, but (depending on your perspective) awful, content can be shared, but it will not be recommended to users in For You
The fight will be managed by my and Zuck’s foundations (not UFC).

Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all.

I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location.
@cb_doge @lindayaX True
@astro_greek Am getting into better shape
@WholeMarsBlog You mean 11.4.7? That should be going to wide release within a week. 

Version 12, which an almost total rewrite (~99% AI) is being tested by our QA drivers. 

Too much new code to go to the public yet, but it is mind-blowing imo.
@Rainmaker1973 Those bastards even get me through my jeans!
@Neuro_Skeptic I love video games
@alx Agreed
@sama Time is a construct of human perception
@Rainmaker1973 Reminds me of Diablo
@xDaily They’re used to a pace of innovation that is slower than continental drift.

Welcome to the fast lane!
@Rainmaker1973 That’s strange
@benshapiro I think the solution here is to price so-called “safe” advertising higher than “unsafe”. 

My companies will happily buy the latter.
@all_in_tok @DavidSacks @theallinpod Even Stalin couldn’t take Finland in the Winter War. When the entire local population is against you, winning is extremely difficult.
@teslaownersSV 🤔 dunno
@stevenmarkryan The future is gonna be wild
@DirtyTesLa No problem to farm away, so long as you’re posting interesting or funny material
@Teslaconomics A lot of people met or at least got to know someone on this platform.

If you like their posts, good chance you’ll like the person too.
@Jason Don’t forget to enjoy the ups, even though there will be downs, otherwise what’s the point of having ups?
@waitbutwhy Honey is neither animal, plant or fungus
@cb_doge But they have to be verified users or it is trivial to scam
@xDaily Cool feature for subscribers
This essentially means that X Premium (fka Twitter Blue) is free for accounts that generate above 5M views. 

Note, only views from verified handles count, as scammers will otherwise use bots to spam views to infinity.
@oshea @X We need to hustle and get our recruiting product available at scale!
This platform is by far the best way to reach world leaders, CEOs and the cognoscenti in general
@DustinStockton @SenatorBennet The crazy thing is that we are the only ones to open source our algorithm and on X it is the community that does (great) fact-checking, including on advertisers and me!
Great product engineering &amp; design sessions today with the 𝕏 team!

Future is looking bright.
@JonErlichman Interesting
@SawyerMerritt I pretty much just use (Recommended) For You
@FredLohner Nice
Highly recommend doing this!
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @KrassenCast Cool!
@thesimple_sarah @Tesla @tesla_na Cool
@heyitsyashu Reuters and facts are not well acquainted
@stillgray Damn
@growing_daniel This is happening in many major US cities
@Authority_AI I used history podcasts on a timer to fall asleep!
@ChrisJBakke So cringe 😂
Highly recommend “The Explorers” podcast for stories of exploration of many cultures over the ages. 

Am currently learning about Ibn Battuta, an amazingly widely traveled Islamic explorer.
@Teslaconomics Wise words
@MuskUniversity Absolutely. I’m calling out NY Times &amp; ADL in particular.
@stclairashley Sam Harris has gone flat out insane. It’s tragic.
@greg_price11 @MrAndyNgo Who was the lawyer?
@Noahpinion This is crazy. We need them!
@AiBreakfast Interesting
@AutismCapital Making parody memes of the current thing
@KanekoaTheGreat @VivekGRamaswamy He has a great point
@RichardDawkins Many parallels
@TexasLindsay_ True
@SherrodBrown “Experts at CNN” 🤣🤣
@SethDillon I’m saying that a moral civilization (where trust is relatively high among citizens) will outcompete an immoral one.
@WSBChairman Looks like we might just survive after all
@cb_doge Not a super high bar these days, as SNL has become so woke
@RichardHanania Not exactly subtle. It is unequivocally a genocide song!
@xDaily This is important and fair to advertisers. They don’t have a right to censor this platform, but they absolutely do have a right to say what content appears next to their ads. 

That said, I would recommend advertisers not be super concerned about content adjacency. Tesla and
@SaraHigdon_ @EdKrassen That is tampering with the jury and deeply messed up. Let’s see how the appeal goes.
@JackBox When we were building our first company, my brother &amp; I ate dinner at the Jack in the Box on El Camino every night! @kimbal
@stevenmarkryan Just the fact that the media chooses what to write about and what to ignore means you are essentially *always* being misled
@cb_doge Liking my own post liking my own post 😂
@EdKrassen While not perfect, the American legal system is generally very good
@fentasyl Are you sure about those numbers?
@stevenmarkryan That was a long time ago and the rest of industry still hasn’t caught up!
@DrJBhattacharya The public blowback over those unconscionable restrictions will be severe
@ZubyMusic Censoring the public on behalf of governments is a lot of work!
@cb_doge Lmaooo
@xDaily Well of course they prefer censorship-friendly social media. 

The Australian public does not.
@McDonalds That Oreo Frappé looks awesome!
@micsolana People see in others what they fear exists in themselves. @mattyglesias is one such person.
@MuskUniversity Our policies make this inevitable
@MuskUniversity Obviously
Starship Super Heavy Booster https://t.co/3065srPugD
@truedivineright @dom_lucre 😂

Would be a genius move on their part
@dom_lucre If you can find advertisers that want to advertise alongside your content, then you get revenue share. We cannot make them do this.
@Rasmussen_Poll @Support @lindayaX Our user-seconds have reached all time highs in recent months, so something is wrong. Will investigate.
@cb_doge The product is just … not good
@TEDchris @tferriss @joerogan @megynkelly @amolrajan @lexfridman @kwelkernbc @karaswisher @JohnDonvan That sounds like a good idea too. 

This is really fighting as (I believe) a noble sport. We also hope, with humility, to express our admiration for those who have fought before for noble causes.
@dvorahfr Will inquire
@EdKrassen Exactly!
@greg16676935420 You’re welcome
@WokelyCorrect Why is Western media like this?
@Teslaconomics Good question
@stclairashley They absolutely mean literal genocide.

Why are organizations like @ADL silent?
@CollinRugg *collude
@CollinRugg Fate loves irony. Over what period of time did McGonigal collide with Russia?
@GRDecter Exactly. He can’t lose, which is why he loves these crazy high fed rates.
@dogeofficialceo They also used to say that you couldn’t play video games for money too, now we have esports pro leagues!
@HXMnCK @growing_daniel Literally true. The fewer people that sign up, the more revenue that X keeps!
@MuskUniversity Exactly
@cb_doge So glad to see this happening!
@anothercohen Will see if this is feasible. It would add a lot of complexity.
Falcon flies again
@EndWokeness @ConCaracal Shame on @nytimes. Shame, shame, shame.
@WholeMarsBlog 13 years is a long tour of duty. Zach will spend time with friends &amp; family, then do something else.
@FredLohner Yeah, this will be great!
@billmaher Why do they keep pushing these lies?
@ajtourville People have no idea yet
@CollinRugg @CatchUpFeed Good for him!
@ConCaracal @EndWokeness The lack of condemnation about EFF actively calling for genocide is appalling
@PeterDiamandis I guess I’d try to figure if there is some way to know what it is like outside the simulation
@EvaFoxU Something is deeply broken in western journalism
@0xgaut Pretty much 😂
@xDaily Since the algorithm recommends posts based on how much time people spend on them, both video and text content posted on this platform naturally get boosted more than links off platform, as the time spent on a link is short
@xDaily Maximizing unregretted user-seconds
I would like to thank Zach Kirkhorn for his many contributions to Tesla over the course of 13 often difficult years. 

Much appreciated and best wishes for the next stage of his career.
@ehikian This will be cool
More interesting than you may expect
@vincent13031925 Still don’t know if real or AI-generated 😂
@TheWarEnglish Yum cake 🎂
@dvorahfr If the goal of AI is curiosity, aka understanding the universe, then it will aide humanity, because we are more interesting than not-humanity
@SethDillon A moral civilization, by which I mean one where individuals act for the collective good, will outcompete an immoral civilization. 

Said another way, teamwork is power!
@MuskUniversity We still have a long way to go
@Teslaconomics Nobody lives forever
@WholeMarsBlog I think we may have figured out some aspects of AGI. The car has a mind. Not an enormous mind, but a mind nonetheless.
@Austen McDonalds is technically a Scottish name
@goth600 So few know how the Internet actually works. 

Starlink is an entirely new internet in space – homogeneous, rather than heterogeneous.
@nichegamer @Blizzard_Ent Werebear lightning storm druid
@goth600 If information fought a war against drugs, which one would win?
@telmudic It is definitely confusing. I mean, how many people are coming to dinner?
@iCaleb7 @Tesla Yeah
@cb_doge Yeah, it was nonstop impersonation, including many “verified” accounts
Building Starlink version 2 constellation
@theallinpod @X Btw, room temperature superconductors would be nice to have, but not super transformative
@theallinpod @X Great to see the full show here!

I highly recommend using pic in pic with sped up video for maximum enjoyment of this platform.
@teslaownersSV @Blizzard_Ent Diablo I &amp; II were excellent. Didn’t love Diablo III, but IV is great.
@cb_doge Oh the iron y
@HallofFameMemes Strong contender for sure
Diablo IV is a great game. Nice work by the @Blizzard_Ent team!
Am going with @WWE as my fighting style
@lexfridman @GeorgesStPierre @TeamKhabib Great video!
@cb_doge Yeah
@ashleevance It even works in Antarctica. Quite well, actually, since demand there is low.
@cb_doge You mean these platforms? 🤣🤣
https://t.co/3pWM0vUmbT
@MarmotRespecter Go on …
@alx A quill 🪶
@Tillsbury1 @xDaily Exact date is still in flux. I’m getting an MRI of my neck &amp; upper back tomorrow. 

May require surgery before the fight can happen. Will know this week.
@liuyuxxd We are working on semantic (AI) search. Will show posts of X that match the meaning of your search, not just the text.
@liuyuxxd Definitely
@justinamash Well said
@BillyM2k Would be cool to see Cybertruck tackle this
@EdKrassen @maurice_lippy If the fight is short, I probably win. If long, he may win on endurance.

I am much bigger and there is a reason MMA has weight divisions.
@EdKrassen I weigh at least 300 lbs
@cb_doge Pretty much
Zuck v Musk fight will be live-streamed on 𝕏.

All proceeds will go to charity for veterans.
@Kristennetten Product testing &amp; working out kills two birds with one stone!

I swing one of the 45 lb weights for a kettle bell workout.
@WallStreetSilv I did not vote for him last election, but such aggressive legal action against a former president is not right
@cb_doge Aiming to get to 50 pound free weights this week. I build muscle fast. Physical endurance is my weak spot, so I’m aiming to make this quick.
@_LoveArtDeco It’s a civilized form of war. Men love war.
Am lifting weights throughout the day, preparing for the fight. 

Don’t have time to work out, so I just bring them to work.
@BasedBeffJezos Bezos is pretty based these days tbh
@Kristennetten CEO is fake title. You need a president,  a controller and a secretary for a C Corp, but all the chief [whatever] officer stuff is superfluous.
Immersive video on this platform is starting to get pretty good. 

Just tap on any video &amp; swipe up when you want to move on.
@mysteriouskat 🔥🔥 I would buy something there for the humor alone
@KettlebellLife I often forget to do that
@cb_doge Physics and engineering could taught so much better than they are. 

A narrative history of how and why they were developed is captivating.
@icreatelife Nice
@Chachu3m @Snoop_AFC @Jetskigrizzly @Jacksy_eth Might watch that
@cctvidiots Alligators are not all that dangerous, but crocs snatch people from the shore and boats every year
@cb_doge I once went on a date in college and decided to order dishes backwards, starting with dessert first, which also was not a winning move
@joehansenxx @Teslaconomics @lindayaX Not super cheap, but 10X original value is still possible
@zerohedge Soros arbitraged politics. He figured out that spending small amounts of money in many obscure, but influential, races is far more effective than money spent on major contests.

The mistake people make is thinking that he did it for the good of humanity. He hates humanity.
@helloitstanya98 @X @SweetSirenDream @kerrikgray @aliciatoralll @linda_ungureanu @_LoveArtDeco @RenataKonkoly @Kristennetten @teslanatrix @captainarve We considered calling it Balls, but that could be misinterpreted
@cctvidiots Famous last words
@MarkCrtlC @alx Thanks Zuck!
@alx It’s literally more complicated than 99% of passwords at this point!
@stclairashley Indeed
@Teslaconomics He doesn’t really need to prepare for anything. The so-called “risk free” rate offered by treasury bills is ridiculously high.
@pmarca Feels like that for sure
@Kara_Creates Great, let’s have at it!
@alx It is how I imagine him speaking
@pmarca Technology is accelerating
@Teslaconomics Bizarrely, government funding is still being directed to hydrogen trucks. It is idiotic.
@cb_doge It makes people feel sad, because everyone on there seems to be living this incredible life, even if they’re actually suicidally sad.

I prefer the truth, even it is dark.
@yacineMTB @ID_AA_Carmack We always have been, just that now it’s digital instead of biological
@ConceptualJames That needs to change. 

And donors should withhold funding until there is change. That will fix things pronto.
@farzyness Yeah
@mysteriouskat I’m part of the CYA
@icreatelife Too real
@Austen And we won’t just sue, it will be extremely loud and we will go after the boards of directors of the companies too
@teslaownersSV Good question
@anothercohen @Stonks_dot_com Literally
@Stonks_dot_com Cramer’s track record is unmatched
@billykyle @Tesla @teslaownersSV Cool
@EvasTeslaSPlaid Nice shot
@dogeofficialceo lmfao
@mysteriouskat @davidvolodzko This does sound like a good case
@libsoftiktok @Kara_Creates Kara, is that accurate?
@SethDillon With enemies this foolish, he doesn’t need friends to get elected
@waitbutwhy 😂 nice
@SawyerMerritt I’m told by my team that the credits are not currently stackable, so the best case is more like roughly $20k and there are significant income restrictions. Still very compelling.
@EdKrassen Also, people should watch The Life of Brian. Best movie ever.
@EdKrassen Exactly
If you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform, we will fund your legal bill.

No limit. 

Please let us know.
@Austen Super annoying
@tszzl That game demonstrated outstanding insight into the stepping stones of actual civilizational growth
@MuskUniversity Obviously
@saturdayboxes @tszzl This platform is a harsh judge. I love it.
@MuskUniversity You can learn anything you want online
@telmudic I have a long memory
@JonErlichman Diet Coke &amp; Coke Zero are awesome. I don’t care if drinking gallons of it shaves a bit of life off. Worth it.
@JonErlichman Dang, that is a lot of 🍎
@SethDillon Exactly
@SawyerMerritt Really?
@alexisohanian @garrytan You can add your own posts to the highlights tab on your profile and bookmark posts of others in different folders
@garrytan Definitely! That’s coming soon.
@DuneQuoteBot *memes
@shoe0nhead They even suck at hypocrisy
@cb_doge @X The team worked long into the night. I only left work around 3am.
To be eligible for your ad revenue share, you must be an X Premium (Blue) subscriber. 

The ad money will otherwise be kept by X if you are not an X Premium (Blue) subscriber. 

This program is open to everyone.
@ElonMuskAOC I wonder what kind of hotel we would design if we did so. 

Our Tesla futuristic diner (Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging) in LA should be ready later this year.
Long, but interesting. I recommend playing at 1.5 speed with pic in pic, so you can still use X and other apps while listening.
@FutureJurvetson @cb_doge @woodhaus2 Hi Steve!
@RampCapitalLLC Amazing
@EMostaque Tell me about it …
@marmars Please add your suggestions for features &amp; fixes in this reply thread. 

We want video on this platform to be the best in the world.
Interest in ad rev share by content creators has far exceeded our expectations, so will take a few more days to process. 

Major payouts coming soon!
@EndWokeness They are actually killing white farmers every day. It’s not just a threat.
@cb_doge @X Really?
@DC_Draino The public deserves the right to see this
@ElonMuskAOC @catturd2 True
@catturd2 Hear me out “Instagram … but without the pics!”
@zerohedge Good
@alx Aiming for 50 lb weights next week
@BillyM2k @disclosetv Absolutely
@CramerTracker Yikes
@jordanbpeterson We do need to move towards a sustainable energy economy, but we don’t need to make people’s lives miserable or demonize oil &amp; gas (which is definitely needed for many years to come) along the way.
@helloitstanya98 @RenataKonkoly @teslanatrix @SweetSirenDream @kerrikgray @captainarve @DimaZeniuk @JaneidyEve @EvaFoxU @jessica_kirsh Sorry about that. We’re working on it.
@anothercohen I have many good memories of taking my kids to the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove in LA
@GailAlfarATX The overarching vision is for X to be a maximally effective group mind for humanity
@ZubyMusic I have serious concerns about SSRIs, as they tend to zombify people. 

Occasional use of Ketamine is a much better option, in my opinion. I have a prescription for when my brain chemistry sometimes goes super negative.
@stevenmarkryan Success is not guaranteed, but excitement is!
@cb_doge And we never will
@PrinceVogel Interesting idea
@LibertyCappy Seems low
@ZubyMusic @Cobratate True 😂
@CBSNews Makes sense
@enriquebrgn Which is great! They should be.
@cb_doge That’s the goal!
@jordanbpeterson He has repeatedly called for killing of all white people. The “for now” part is false.
@woodhaus2 Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla!
Preparing for next Starship flight! This time, I think we have ~50% probability of reaching orbital velocity, however even getting to stage separation would be a win.
@alx Yeah
@anothercohen Austin is booming
@stillgray And NY Times is his racial genocide apologist
@EndWokeness Melama literally just had a stadium of people chanting for racial genocide. He is beneath contempt.
@DirtyTesLa @Tesla Yeah, it’s much better
@tunguz The crazy thing is that they’re happening simultaneously!
@EFarraro Exactly
@farzyness One day it seems like we’re headed for a recession, the next day everything’s fine. Hard to tell what the heck is going on!
@Gedmark @VardaSpace Would be awesome if this is commercially viable. Super hope so.
@charliekirk11 Extremely disturbing
@BillyM2k Dogs rock
@waitbutwhy Either an x or a post
@NameRedacted247 Good question

Legacy media and the truth … https://t.co/akvZuYuTm5
@MattWallace888 I like it 😂
@EndWokeness Yeah, they are contemptible hypocrites
@ZubyMusic Yeah. More and more countries are.
@ZubyMusic Absolutely! Humanity is dwindling and we are being led by geriatrics.
@netcapgirl Yikes
@0xgaut Does look beautiful tbh
@zGuz Their entire coverage of SBF was absurdly positive. They all the sympathy in the world for SBF and none for those he scammed.
The New York Times actually has the nerve to support calls for genocide! If ever there was a time to cancel that publication, it is now.

You can read their articles for free anyway using https://t.co/2NjvMTsWmj. https://t.co/ow11wxw7Ny
@alx Zuck himself barely uses it
@MuskUniversity Yeah
@LibertyCappy They lost the plot long ago. Shame on @NYTimes. Shame, shame shame.
@WholeMarsBlog It’s been a while, but I used to love doing that
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla It’s been great working with @PepsiCo
@nikitabier Seriously
@xQc Yeah, needs refinement
@nypost Happens much more often than people realize. Too much pure water desalinates your body.
@KanekoaTheGreat @joerogan @patrickbetdavid True
@gigaj0ule Hopefully makes it past phase 3
@EvaFoxU Probably not 😂
@demishassabis @emblebi When will the first product that uses AlphaFold ship?
@alx Why do you say nothing, @ADL?
Live video now works reasonably well. Just tap the button that looks like a camera when you post: https://t.co/ILQEQFmY5R
@EvaFoxU Still true
@ID_AA_Carmack i^2 heating is tough
@GRDecter No we aren’t
@GRDecter How many times has he predicted a crash that didn’t happen?
@WholeMarsBlog Good grief
@SawyerMerritt @GerberKawasaki Ross doesn’t seem to realize that content creators need to earn a living.

We are hell bent on making this platform the best place on Earth for great content creators!
And I learn more here than anywhere else, from artificial intelligence to new discoveries in superconductivity!
I get more laughs from this platform than everything else combined and I hope you do too.

Thanks for posting such great content!
@cb_doge It committed the cardinal sin: boring people to death
@gekaminsky @dcexaminer @JudiciaryGOP Interesting. 

Center for Censorship, Disinformation and Hate! That’s what they actually do.
@BillAckman @kgreifeld Yeah, short term T-bills are a no-brainer
@BillyM2k Looks awesome. Is it off the shelf or modified?
@unusual_whales No work is being done on this to the best of my knowledge
@ZubyMusic Absolutely
@micsolana We will find out when those donors testify under penalty of perjury
@KanekoaTheGreat It had to be explained in terms most would understand.

The point was not actually to create a traditional bank or “send payments”, but rather to fix the information problem that people call money.
@cb_doge Exactly
@WallStreetSilv Best name ever
@SethDillon @TheBabylonBee Definitely worth it!
@PaulGoodman24 They do at my companies
Tap the “…” on upper right when video is in full screen mode.

@DrKnowItAll16 Cool, more people should post long videos on this platform
@enriquebrgn far better to delete code than add it
@xDaily This is bizarre. They want us to pay *them* for traffic to their site where they make advertising revenue and we don’t!?
@krassenstein Exactly! 🙏
And a massive amount of infrastructure software &amp; hardware improvements!

We will do a post on that too. The list of technical achievements by the X team is incredible.
@dogeofficialceo Agreed, we’re working on it
@HSajwanization Will do
@krassenstein Absolutely. You can also hold subscriber-only Spaces and have amazing conversations with people around the world!
@libsoftiktok Yeah, that’s coming soon
Super Important to Support Creators!

If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting. 

People from every corner of the world post incredible content on 𝕏, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred
Interesting interview of Devon Archer by @TuckerCarlson
@cb_doge Maybe we’re in the afterlife
@itsALLrisky Lot of merit to decentralized control
@ggreenwald @lsanger This is a major problem. 

Also, it seems that the real purpose of many legacy media orgs is simply to provide “official media citations” that support a politically biased Wiki page.

Where do you even find physical magazines or newspapers these days –the scroll reliquary!?
@lovati @Benioff Exactly. If successful, X will enter the vernacular in ways that we don’t yet know. 

“Saw it on X”
“Posted on X”
“Paid on X”
“Drunk texted my X gf”
Etc
@ZubyMusic Was buried in Tesla work all day, so unfortunately missed out, but that is good to hear 😂

So long as this platform is not boring, it will succeed.
@justindross @patrickc This is the limiting factor
@patrickc Indeed, many parts of the world are reaching high peak levels of renewable energy production!

Due to the obviously intermittent nature of wind and solar power, the limiting factor for renewable energy growth is increasingly stationary battery packs at utility scale.
Thank you for your contributions to information accuracy on this platform!
@MuskUniversity Critical thinking should be the first thing we teach kids
@MuskUniversity Yeah
@ylecun Such a sharp drop in the US life expectancy curve doesn’t seem correct
@Scobleizer Vehicle control is the final piece of the Tesla FSD AI puzzle. That will drop &gt;300k lines of C++ control code by ~2 orders of magnitude.

It is training as I write this. Our progress is currently training compute constrained, not engineer constrained.
@GonzaloLira1968 Troubling posts
@ScottPolhamus @fireship_dev What won’t be?

It is unreal how much of AI is data curation and heavy compute. Certainly isn’t lines of code!
@fireship_dev 😂

I loved coding so much. It was cool that people would give you money for it too.
Unless there are a few issues where you at least slightly disagree with your political party, then you are not in a political party, you are in a cult
@deliprao It isn’t clear to me why people like Feynman’s physics lectures so much. I found them to be ok, but not great. Wouldn’t recommend them either to those who want to learn physics or those who have.

His non-physics books, like “Surely you’re joking …” are great.
@alex_avoigt Hydrogen is a dumb way to store chemical energy in so many ways
@ilyasut But criticizing posts on this platform is not much harder than making them
@sparklingruby Exactly
@monitoringbias True
Just a little cheeky humor
@theapplehub Blaze your glory!
@sparklingruby Discovery is a wonderful thing
@JohnCornyn @Tesla Thank you for visiting with us at Tesla HQ
@ZubyMusic Things have changed a lot even since ~2017
@OwenSparks_ Is Barbie (the movie) maybe better than Oppenheimer? Is that even possible? Who has seen both?
@monitoringbias Too much sensitivity around offending almost anyone is killing comedy!
@alx You can tell it’s propaganda when they choose terms that are impossible to invert. Who is “PRO” hate speech!? 🤣

Their actual goals have nothing to do with hate speech and everything to do with censorship of public dialogue.
@alx Mostly agree
@cb_doge Some people just have a dirty mind … 😂
@intelligent_eat @BillyM2k That’s what I’m wondering. Sounds like most of the movie is about his life before &amp; after Los Alamos, which is about 1% as interesting as what actually happened in Los Alamos.
@Benioff That’s great! Very important that people come into the office or the stores, restaurants, etc can’t stay in business.
It is important for more people to come to work in San Francisco or the rest of the city can’t survive
@WSBChairman Sigh
Oh I get it now! Some people are reading the t-shirt as saying “I ♥️ an AI”. What a funny misinterpretation 😂👀
@MuskUniversity There is a downside to this: my internal mental torture is high
@MuskUniversity Yeah
@RichardHanania This was and continues to be a hard problem. SpaceX is building a new Internet in space.
@netcapgirl If in legal, pivot to fintech
@cb_doge Programming for sure
@PeterDiamandis Evolutionary bias. 

Positive news is nice to know, but negative news, for almost our entire evolutionary history, could mean death, so higher priority.

What really messes things up in the modern era is that negative news can now reach everyone on Earth, but still triggers a
@krassenstein Bears aren’t real

@WholeMarsBlog @moskov Moskovitz actually said that?
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
Many have offered rich incentives for X (fka Twitter) to move its HQ out of San Francisco.

Moreover, the city is in a doom spiral with one company after another left or leaving.

Therefore, they expect X will move too.

We will not. 

You only know who your real friends are when
Something special coming soon
We just proved it
@BilimleKalin Beautiful

@BillyM2k @sfchronicle wtf 🤡 circus
He keeps calling the police about our sign modifications! 🤡
Found pic of 𝕏 landlord in San Francisco https://t.co/3CKSAr9ek2
@tszzl People should read Feynman’s books
@tszzl It is hard to move the needle with physics these days. We need order of magnitude+ more powerful/sensitive hadron colliders for small stuff &amp; space telescopes for big stuff.

Civilization alternates between being science-limited (rare) &amp; engineering-limited (frequent).
@BillyM2k It’s true 🖤
@AdrianDittmann Who are you going to believe, me or your own lying ears!?
@AdrianDittmann I am a fully recursive psyop.
Imagine saying that to elon.

@CitizenFreePres @SenRandPaul is right that we need to stop impeaching and indicting presidents, unless our republic would otherwise be endangered, which is not the case at this moment.

@TalulahRiley Congratulations! ♥️
@_jairath Mostly fake. That platform is overrun by bots next-level. They implemented view limits, but not write limits.
@Liv_Boeree @isabelleboemeke Post on this platform too!
@unusual_whales Some games are better than sex tbh
Extremely concerning!
@cb_doge The goal of my companies is simply to be as useful as possible, never to kill the competition. 

Competing to serve the people is a good thing.
@imPenny2x @telmudic Same. Many hours of sleep went to X.
@stclairashley Once again, parody of NYT &amp; actual NYT are indistinguishable!
@ConceptualJames Tragic
@unusual_whales How exactly did they *do* this survey?

Maybe the ones who didn’t answer are [ahem] otherwise occupied …
I’m not saying there are aliens, but …
@MLS I hope USA gets better at the beautiful game!
@imPenny2x We can still do a lot better. Analytics should ideally give you specific insight into actions you can take to increase engagement.

@soren_iverson I love Christmas songs!
@WholeMarsBlog I tested the version 12 alpha build today. It is mind-blowing.

@XNewsDaily That seems fair
@mysteriouskat To sleep with women endlessly without love is a cursed and hollow life
@EdKrassen Only people on our CSE team have seen those pictures. For now, we will delete those posts and reinstate the account.
@EdKrassen The reason for suspension should be shown, along with ability to appeal quickly and easily. There are so many layers of software (20+ million lines) that this is much harder than it should be.

I’m told that this account was suspended for posting child exploitation pictures
@SciGuySpace SpaceX provided its knowledge of crewed parachute systems to Boeing and we are happy to be helpful in any other ways.

Designing parachutes for orbital, crewed spacecraft is much harder than it may seem. Was a major challenge for SpaceX.
@Nate_Esparza Mars might have a bigger brand
@SawyerMerritt Will consider
@XNewsDaily Or they can just pay $1000/month for a verified organization subscription with the ability to convey that organizational authority to affiliates. This more than pays for itself in organic reach.

The reason for the $1000/month is to set a moderately high bar to be a verified org,
@HardcoreHistory Is there something we need to address?

@Kristennetten Lot of great people at 𝕏
@pmarca I hope you’re right
@SwipeWright Unreal
@SciGuySpace They need to go all-in on reusability or be utterly uncompetitive.

Rockets are no different from other transport technologies, just harder to make reusable. 

No one would buy a single-use airplane, car or even bicycle! You’d need to tow another car just for the return trip 🤣

You’ll soon also be paid for ads appearing when others view your profile page, approximately doubling payouts

@thackerpd @CCDHate Who is funding this organization? They spread disinformation and push censorship, while claiming the opposite. Truly evil.
@farzyness What actually matters is ads served to other verified accounts (so we know they’re not bots).

We’re working on bugs that caused very few ads to be served on some accounts and also revenue sharing ads served on profile views. This could 10X or more payouts to some users.

@darewecan @EndWokeness @CommunityNotes Truth is more important than profits
@WholeMarsBlog They stand so far to the left that I’m surprised they can even see the right!
@EndWokeness Same happens to me, right wing accounts and even advertisers. Latter not good for revenue (sigh).
@imPenny2x Wearing their jiu jitsu gi
@Remy_Legal You’re welcome. 

Friends need to know whether you simply want to feel supported or actually to solve a problem (men often assume the latter), which may entail painful words, so best to tell them explicitly.
@0xgaut Can I interest you in a little Kelvin? 🥰
@BillyM2k @krassenstein @InternetHOF @MrBeast The set of all things not “far right” is very small these days, media sources say
@TitterDaily Not a high priority, given many pressing issues. I suggest images &amp; links for now.
@TitterDaily Yeah
@sdamico Great idea!
Red wine test
@krassenstein @InternetHOF @BillyM2k @MrBeast Exactly
@TheBabylonBee Lmaooo, but actually they do
@garrytan It is insane
@garrytan Smart move by Canada
@BillboardChris He should have his day in court, but the allegations, and some things he has admitted saying, are troubling
@unusual_whales There is trash, there is utter garbage and then there is BI
@alifarhat79 The Ford Lightning is a good vehicle, just somewhat expensive, especially given the high interest rates these days for any kind of loan
@DrKnowItAll16 Tesla has been focused on this for many years, given the extreme energy constraints of an electric car vs a data center
@TheRealBuzz You inspired us all
@LarckeningXuruo @wesyang @pmarca I won the first round, but he was taking it easy on me
@Enezator Nice

Some are OnlyGANs
@terronk @tszzl True
@Openskies13 Cool
@tegmark @UN Absolutely
Whatever sins this platform may have, being boring is not one of them
@Remy_Legal Friends are far better than therapy. The incentive structure is to keep you hooked, never “cured”. 

Be especially wary of therapists in expensive neighborhoods – their true loyalty is to their landlord, not you.

@CollinRugg People actually love people, even strangers
@jeremyjudkins_ We’re trying hard to stop bots &amp; trolls on this platform, so that may be part of the reason
@EdKrassen @krassenstein 😂😂 

Both you guys post quality content &amp; take feedback well
@tunguz Negative feedback is good for keeping ego under control
@BillyM2k @MyDogeCTO Technical managers need to write or at least review code some of the time or they lose touch
@farzyness That is my impression
@greg16676935420 He’s really burning the midnight oil lol
@readwise @kkiy90 @omarsar0 @karpathy Just use the bookmark function
@joerogan Possibly. 

Dark matter is what seems most sketch to me.
@LibertyCappy Exactly
@farzyness @lindayacc Complexity is like an innovation drag coefficient. We are desperately trying to reduce complexity in order to innovate faster.
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@EvaFoxU Great!
@mayemusk Exactly
@krassenstein @ChooseGoodKarma Yeah, currently Spaces is all cost, zero revenue
@krassenstein Good ideas
@PicturesFoIder I mean Starlink glued to a PC gaming rig

@teslaownersSV This article is negative, of course, but we did not see the increase in advertising revenue that was expected in June.

July is a bit more promising.
@imPenny2x Double

@agarwal He definitely needs to go
@greg16676935420 He doesn’t seem to care about his new product
@bradsferguson Length of quote posts as seen on timeline will be shortened significantly. You will still be able to click through and see the whole thing, but QT’s can’t take up an entire screen. 

Ads will also be shortened in vertical height. Cost of an ad will be proportionate to its size.
@antoniogm Great!
@jim_linz @DrKnowItAll16 We’re working on it. For now, you can use Apple Airplay to watch on a TV.
@SethDillon What does “report content” mean?
@WSBChairman @zerohedge Sure, but I suggest doing both. If X Corp subscriptions aren’t working out, you can always turn it off. 

May as well try it for a few weeks.
@zerohedge You should enable subscriptions on this platform. Could even be at a higher price than off platform, as some will pay a premium for convenience.

@alx @Lukewearechange My top invention ever
@WallStreetSilv All day, every day
@teslaownersSV As promised. 

Soon, we will share ad revenue from profile page views, which should roughly double payouts.

Note, only views from verified users count, as it is otherwise trivial to bot scam the view count.
@stevenmarkryan @TeslaBoomerMama 😂 only had about 5k followers back then
@TitterDaily Done
@imPenny2x Great
@cb_doge @linda_ungureanu Yeah
@cb_doge Only $7/month or ~23 cents/day if bought annually via web
@imPenny2x Change just went live. Working now?
@teslaownersSV Will make a massive difference
@imPenny2x We will increase the rate limit for verified users by 50%. Should take effect within a few hours.
@imPenny2x Wow. Ok, we will increase the rate limit.
@CatchUpFeed I think she’s cool tbh
@DurantQuotesBot Vastly so
@imPenny2x How much time does your phone say you’re spending on this platform?

Should take ~8 hours of almost continuous scrolling to hit the limit unless we’re doing something wrong.
@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k Working on it
@imPenny2x That shouldn’t be happening for a subscription verified account. How much time have you spent on this platform today?
@BillyM2k We are working on it. High priority.
@DogecoinNorway Yeah
@DanielleFong What needs to be improved most urgently about DMs?
@TeslaAIBot Should be a gamechanger for reducing DM spam
@Noahpinion I want the best outcome for the people.

Russia has at least 4 times the artillery of Ukraine and 10 times the ammunition. 

We have run out of normal ammunition to send Ukraine, so now send them cluster bombs in desperation, debasing ourselves with no change to the outcome.
@RepThomasMassie Thank you for trying to stop this debasement of America
@Noahpinion Sending more weapons will change the body count, but not the outcome

@netcapgirl On double envelopment day

Canny orphans of Cannae

Salt sown as epilogue.
@icreatelife Exactly
@SawyerMerritt Agreed
@fasc1nate What was really wished for https://t.co/lWGDTbYqRL
@martyrmade America has always condemned as evil those who use cluster bombs, but now we send them to be used? 

No good will come of this. Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy.
@Rainmaker1973 Our brain paints the world
@netcapgirl We’re still negative cash flow, due to ~50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load. Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.
@cb_doge He laughed his ass off?
@JaneidyEve @Tesmanian_com Starlink serves the least served
@paulg @dflieb @garrytan Definitely
@LindseyGrahamSC How does this end?
@farzyness @xai Thanks, this is helpful
@krassenstein @WholeMarsBlog I hope so
@jameslavish It’s actually way worse than that when including unfunded obligations
@SawyerMerritt @DriveTeslaca It never caught fire. Due to my foolish driving, I crashed the car, doing an aerial 360 on Sand Hill Rd with Peter Thiel, on our way to meet with Mike Moritz.
@SawyerMerritt Lot of good memories of that car. It is such exquisite engineering &amp; design!

After Zip2, I had a choice of either a house in Palo Alto or a condo plus a McLaren F1. Took me about a nanosecond to decide.
@loganclarkhall Based
@SawyerMerritt HW3 cars are actually more advanced than HW4 cars right now, because it takes time to write software &amp; NN train for HW4
@sriramk We should be actively recruiting super talented people, not putting up obstacles!
@EvaFoxU Scary Boston Dynamics robot videos is why Tesla is making Optimus
@brackin SF will rebound bigtime if the people manifest their will to make it happen
@alx @xai That is part of my concern
@bennyjohnson Japan is awesome 🇯🇵 ♥️
@WallStreetSilv Yeah, roughly triple usage per capita of USA
@Jason @anothercohen Whatever the percentages, it’s still the best system on Earth. I respect anyone who grinds hard for years to make useful products &amp; services, even if it doesn’t work out in the end.

@cb_doge And I love ice cream
@imPenny2x Exactly. And those who try to game the system in ways that materially diminish value for other users of this platform will get dinged.
@wesyang @pmarca Smashed my disc in a sumo fight https://t.co/j9slxsDa9c
@wesyang @pmarca I might need an operation to strengthen the titanium plate holding my C5/C6 vertebrae together, but otherwise good to go
@pmarca Great post! 

Pretty much the only thing that will get me to work out is fight prep. I know a lot of people love it, but I hate working out. 

My kids did Brazilian jiu jitsu for a decade, now two of them do Muay Thai.

@CramerTracker @greg16676935420 Brands doing cringe posts 🤮
@JamesEsses Major problem
@Noahpinion Is there a chart by college major? I suspect that is a big factor.
@krassenstein Good advice. 

Very important note that the algorithm increasingly gives weight to time spent on a post, which means putting longform text &amp; video on this platform gets more promotion than off platform.
@ZubyMusic I hate that

@Scobleizer You’re welcome!

This is not in response to competitors. I announced we would do this in February. Sorry it took so long to roll out.

It is only right that content creators are rewarded for their contributions.
@TeslaSynopsis I should wear that
Testing
Spaces discussion with @xAI team tomorrow at 1pm PT
@stevenmarkryan It’s not exactly per impression. What matters is how many ads were shown to other verified users.

Only verified users count, as it is otherwise trivial to game the system with bots.

@TitterDaily FTC overreach has gone absurdly far beyond the legal mandate granted by Congress. 

Weaponization of government agencies for censorship &amp; political machinations needs to stop.

@alx There are no angels in war
@lexfridman @xai I keep telling people I’m an alien, but no one believes me 😉
@dogeofficialceo Yeah
@lexfridman @xai I often wonder where consciousness starts, as we progress from one cell to ~35 trillion cells.

If the Standard Model is correct, then quarks &amp; leptons become “conscious” no later than ~13.8B years from start, assuming there are no sentient aliens.

Btw, where are the aliens!?
@xai And what are the most fundamental unknown questions?

@JohnLeFevre The adjustment will be difficult for many of them, as they are used to being paid a lot for nothing. 

They now have to get a real job, which pays fair wages for work that is actually useful to their fellow human beings. 

A tough, but good transition.
@JohnLeFevre Accurate
It’s true. Something must be done
@Nero Whoa
@Muskstaycalm Thanks :)
Having world war level of national debt without fighting a world war is catastrophic. 

The @DOGE team is tracing and stopping the insane levels of waste and fraud very quickly.

How much time is spent doing pointless “online training”? Sounds pretty bad.

Holy cow, the deficit is even worse than expected!!

Fraud and waste accelerated massively under the Biden administration
Under Biden, FEMA took money AWAY from Americans in need of disaster relief and spent it on 5 star hotels for illegals. 

Pure evil.
No kidding …
They are hiding massive fraud and don’t want their grift to end. 

This is how we know we are over the target.

It is an undemocratic and unconstitutional power grab by a tiny group of radical leftists!
Very true!

Many times, the @DOGE team has found excellent people at the working level in government who want to do the right thing, but have been prevented from doing so by prior management.

CFPB has $711M? That money should be returned to taxpayers.
Under Biden, FEMA betrayed the American people by diverting funds meant for natural disasters to pay for luxury hotels for illegal migrants
Yeah, I can’t emphasize this enough!

The goal of auditing the Social Security Administration is to stop the extreme levels of fraud taking place, so that it remains solvent and protects the social security checks of honest Americans!

That’s it. That’s the goal. End of story.
Definitely not, as they are murderous thugs. This is so crazy!
Among many other things, @DOGE today canceled a $17M project to provide tax policy advice to Liberia. 

Why would anyone think that this is a good use of YOUR tax money? 🤦‍♂️
Listen Larry, we need to stop government spending like a drunken sailor on fraud &amp; waste or America is gonna go bankrupt. 

That does mean a lot of grifters will lose their grift and complain loudly about it.

Yes, that was a huge lie by the Biden administration.

There also appear to be significant funds siphoned from Social Security to pay for illegals.

@DOGE
True
There should definitely be accountability for this

And for damn sure, I’m 1000% more trustworthy than untold numbers of deep state bureaucrats and fraudsters who may be misusing your SSN right now.

@iamyesyouareno Does @ADL still hold this position?
The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.

Those are just the explicit DEI grants found. 

Vastly worse is that EVERY education and research grant made over the past four years required DEI in one form or another.

@JTLonsdale They don’t want to lose votes and criminals vote overwhelmingly Democrat, because Dems are the soft on crime party

One square mile on the surface receives ~2.5 Gigawatts of solar energy. That’s Gigawatts with a “G”. It’s ~30% higher in space. The Starlink global satellite network is entirely solar/battery powered. 

Factoring in solar panel efficiency (25%), packing density (80%) and usable
Once you understand Kardashev Scale, it becomes utterly obvious that essentially all energy generation will be solar. 

Also, just do the math on solar on Earth and you soon figure out that a relatively small corner of Texas or New Mexico can easily serve all US electricity.

Also, busses will not be needed when Tesla rolls out unsupervised full self-driving, as they will take people point to point for a similar cost to a bus ticket.

Strive to greater heights,
For a future brighter than the past,
Waking up each morning inspired,
To learn new secrets of the Universe!
While I don’t think the debate hosts were fair to @realDonaldTrump, @KamalaHarris exceeded most people’s expectations tonight.

That said, when it comes to getting things done, not just saying nice-sounding words, I strongly believe that Trump will do a far better job.

National rent control will destroy the incentive to build new housing. 

National food price controls on supermarkets, which only have few percent profit margin, means empty shelves, just like Venezuela. https://t.co/SdhYncZsxq
@jk_rowling Exciting!⚡️
This is a great example of how companies, franchises and product teams should engage with their fans!
@PatrickJBlum GOAT
@KanekoaTheGreat @DavidSacks @JDVance The big government uniparty is real. Trump is for the people.
But here’s the rub, Tesla never has to bribe Kia drivers to buy a Tesla …
We will never get humanity to Mars if this continues
This is our policy on 𝕏
@Klaus_Arminius That’s terribly sad
@America1stLegal @JudiciaryGOP Terrible
During this mission, Dragon will travel repeatedly through the orbital altitudes of over 10 thousand satellites and bits of space debris. 

No room for error in our calculations.
@wapodavenport Absolutely! It’s ridiculous.
Best deal in America for a Tesla
@AlexBerenson Insane. 

She’s just a puppet, so if interviewed without the answers being fed to her beforehand, she would have no idea what to say.
@WesternLensman Needed a good laugh 🤣 🤣

The @PolarisProgram astronaut mission is headed for an altitude 3 times higher than the Space Station, the furthest that humans have been from Earth in over half a century! https://t.co/lYgsA5vMGk

@johnkrausphotos @PolarisProgram Nothing beats seeing a rocket launch
@esherifftv @PolarisProgram @Starlink Such an epic view
Unless current trends for absurd regulatory overreach are reversed, humanity will be confined to Earth forever
Just over an hour to go before liftoff
@Austen Yeah

– Furthest from Earth that humans have been in over half a century

– First private spacewalk

Yeah
@jonkleinx @levie Exactly
Important
@nypost I’m shocked 🙄
Real question
The publicly-stated goal by almost all leaders of the Democratic Party is to legalize the ~15 million illegal migrants as soon as possible, as well as bring in tens of millions more. 

That would immediately make all swing states deep blue, just like happened in California with
@Yrouel86 Yeah, happens a lot
@DillonLoomis22 Bizarre that so many people still believe the media
@pmarca Removing the immense number of pointless regulations and shifting investment to the private sector is the key
Some good points here
@ChrisJBakke Sounds kinda high
@EndWokeness Yeah
Mad Max is becoming real fast
@hodgetwins I mean … pics or it didn’t happen. 

Oh there *are* pics and video? Hmm … 🤔
@theallinpod @JDVance @allinsummit Interesting

@MikeBenzCyber There is no eye-tracking, audio or tactile input. This is pure thought.
@EvaVlaar Where is @PETA when you need them!?
Great work!
Great rebuttals
@stats_feed Exactly
@charliekirk11 Many good people died, no one got fired for botching the job. That is messed up and will result in future innocent people dying.
@TheRabbitHole84 Not that these puny differences will matter. Compared to digital superintelligence, we are all dumb primates with tiny meat computers.
@TheRabbitHole84 My anecdotal observation is that gay men (perhaps gay women too) have higher than average intelligence
This is the heart of the problem and explains why the Democratic Party won’t even deport illegal immigrant gang members who beat up police on camera, as happened in New York a few months ago.

That’s how badly they want those votes!
@SwipeWright Except, yours was correct, as a simple search of the Internet would prove. 

The Democratic Party core platform has moved far to the left. The Republican Party core platform has moved slightly to the left.
@FinancesWorld @alx Improper priorities, indeed!
@alx Hmm, is this the same place that is now releasing pedophiles from prison in order to make room for innocent citizens who complain about those who are murdering and raping their children?
@JoanHarmon1971 Comforting 😳
@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
@SawyerMerritt And fuel cells and hydrogen combustion cars make LiDAR look smart 😂
Vote for Kamala if you want this to happen to your neighborhood!
@micsolana Incentives, as usual, explain behavior. 

If the Democratic party gains enough voters to win an election by importing them and giving them free stuff, then they will do so.

Only if existing voters are upset enough about this for the Democrats to lose, will it stop.
He is right
@jk_rowling While asleep, your brain is sorting and integrating the thoughts of yesterday to prepare for tomorrow
@WGthink @jk_rowling Both would be bad for creativity
@WesternLensman I can’t believe Harari would say something as dumb as newspapers are reliable. That is idiotic.
Mario Draghi’s critique is accurate. 

A thorough review of EU regulations to eliminate unnecessary rules and streamline activity in Europe would revitalize growth and strengthen competitiveness. 

Things should be default legal, rather than default illegal.
@WholeMarsBlog We should change that so the yoke is stationary, as it is not mechanically coupled to the wheels. Same goes for when it is on Autopilot.
@charliekirk11 We shouldn’t
@niccruzpatane The Cybertruck is a beast

@EndWokeness Biden was just a pretend President … oops, I mean is just a … wait … what’s he doing?
@EndWokeness Yeah
@MarioNawfal These giant endowments are a mistake. 

They allow the universities to become detached from reality.

@SawyerMerritt The McLaren F1 (an amazing sports car) is 50% slower than a Tesla Model S in 0 to 60 mph
@paulg Attempting to land giant spaceships on Mars will happen in that timeframe, but humans are only going after the landings are proven to be reliable.

4 years is best case for humans, might be 6, hopefully not 8.
@WallStreetSilv Weird
@cb_doge Yeah, it’s obviously prone to fraud
@AdrianDittmann Well, then I think Neil will be pleasantly surprised by what SpaceX does in the future
@ajtourville @Starlink Probably best to have a Starlink ground station for remote towns, as that can provide 10s of Gigabits of bandwidth
Not bad, given the circumstances
@MaryTilesTexas Thanks!
@WholeMarsBlog How many fake articles have you seen about Tesla at this point? 100, 1000, maybe several thousand?

WSJ is talking nonsense.

The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in
@jeffreyatucker Indeed
@stillgray Whoa
@MarioNawfal Is this definitely true!?
@WallStreetSilv Max payload to standard Earth reference orbit is actually ~180 tons for Starship when it is fully reusable and ~300 tons if expendable. Latter number is the apples-to-apples number comparing Starship to Saturn V. 

&gt;100 tons to the Starlink orbit is the operational spec minimum.
That’s the plan
@VivekGRamaswamy Yeah
The first Starships to Mars will launch in 2 years when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens.

These will be uncrewed to test the reliability of landing intact on Mars. If those landings go well, then the first crewed flights to Mars will be in 4 years. 

Flight rate will
Nice
SpaceX created the first fully reusable rocket stage and, much more importantly, made the reuse economically viable.

Making life multiplanetary is fundamentally a cost per ton to Mars problem. 

It currently costs about a billion dollars per ton of useful payload to the surface

@sashayanshin Pretty much
@lrocket Definitely for super high pressure tanks, but a stainless steel Starship is roughly similar in mass to a carbon fiber version (which is where we started out) and way cheaper/easier to make.

Stainless gets that massive bump in strength at cryo and needs much less shielding for

Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever.
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head

However, when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars, the public may outlaw the latter. Hopefully not.
To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.
Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future, though, for non-commercial traffic.

Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target &amp; nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
@DanielLockyer We could actually do that...maybe we should
Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)
Can't delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.

Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.

Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.
And pls don't ask me about space elevators  until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge
Reason is Newton's Third Law. In vacuum, there is nothing to "push" against. You must react against ejected mass.

@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon
The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger: https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future.

The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower &amp; weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...

Saw pressure fluctuations on Falcon boost stage liquid oxygen tank. Want to be super careful, so pushing launch to Thurs.
At Disney World w kids for traditional prelaunch visit (first good flight was after riding Space Mountain)
Launch can be viewed live from Cape causeways or via http://t.co/soOCggCpN0 webcast around 5:30 local time on Monday
@DarkSapiens Easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. Done in order to reduce satellite side delta V from 1800 m/s to 1500 m/s.
Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80,000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon).
Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
Tesla Model S Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey highest of any car on road at 99/100 http://t.co/PpuS01S2KN
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than 100,000 gas car fires that kill 100s of people per year?

@SQMInc I don't have a publicist
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Vac thrust of 700 tons means avg of 14 tons/floor of structural steel for a 50 story building.
@williamricci6 50% higher. ~1.3 M lbs sea level and ~1.5 M lbs vacuum thrust. Will be 60% higher with some tweaks.

Am thinking of doing a movie "sequel" of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet
Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change http://t.co/C6H8HrzS8X
Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.
Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
@kn0xvi11ain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round http://t.co/V3XIcob4s8
Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety

Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix.
Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting :)
@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque.
Technically, I "got rich" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds.
@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad.
Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl), who lives in NC http://t.co/pvEmE5pEVN

And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?

@danielmarshal15 It can dig up almost anything.
@JasonPolstein Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately.

@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
@stoneymonster Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.
@yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway.
@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
@rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better.
@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
@darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
@JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
@BigBalli High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.

.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
.@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner.
@malkosh was this in a test drive car (those are all about to be upgraded) or a current customer car?

@sdvillella nice pic!
@RebeccaJarvis Not yet. I look forward to giving that a try.
Random trivia: my grandfather &amp; great grandfather were both born in Minnesota. I was named after my GGF.
Minnesota auto dealers tried to pass legislation to block Tesla stores. Bill was just defeated in Senate. Thanks MN!
@Asherlaw SpaceX is expanding launch ops at Canaveral too. Need 2 locations to handle flight rate and avoid weather risk
Arrived Austin. Talking with TX House about creating an orbital launch complex near Brownsville, then #SXSW keynote tmrw
@navidob Pretty much. Couldn't leave the country of Ibsen without doing something cultural!
Saw a play about Stalin in Norwegian. Like watching mimes with emoticons doing Solzhenitsyn. http://t.co/YsWV6IF3QL
Am in Oslo to thank the Norwegian customers of @TeslaMotors personally. Highest Model S orders per capita in the world.
Just received #Dragon docking clearance from @NASA. Will begin orbital maneuvers to Space Station at 11pm Pacific time.
Would also like to thank @USAirForce for allowing us to use their long range comm system for Dragon in free drift.
Just want to say thanks to @NASA for being the world's coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods!
Orbit raising burn successful. Dragon back on track.
Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green.
Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!
Attempting bring up of thruster pods 2 and 4
Solar array deployment successful
Thruster pod 3 tank pressure trending positive. Preparing to deploy solar arrays.
About to pass over Australia ground station and command inhibit override
Holding on solar array deployment until at least two thruster pods are active
Issue with Dragon thruster pods. System inhibiting three of four from initializing. About to command inhibit override.
Falcon 9 delivered Dragon to its target orbit. All good on the rocket.

@andrewliebchen @_chrissimmons Exactly. Then no need for clean energy subsidies, as externality is priced into mkt behavior
@_ChrisSimmons A carbon tax would affect coal even more than gasoline, so electricity would also become more expensive
One often hears that there is no point in a US carbon tax unless China acts. Well, they just did http://t.co/SIp9NzkulK
Rocket static fire @SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch pad looks good. Engines generated 433 tons of thrust, parameters nominal.

Btw, more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge, v high speed trip &amp; long detours, like NYTimes drive.
@batasrki Yeah, Top Gear pretended the Tesla Roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. Logs showed 50 miles range left.
@tomleykis Thanks Tom! Support of real Tesla customers like yourself who drive the car every day is v much appreciated.
Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media.
Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes "range test". Also lining up other journalists to do same drive.
NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max &amp; took a long detour.

Unquestionably so
@robbystarbuck True
Political corruption at the highest levels
Only Reform can save Britain.
Appears likely to be an act of terrorism. 

Both this Cybertruck and the F-150 suicide bomb in New Orleans were rented from Turo. Perhaps they are linked in some way.
@houmanhemmati This is deeply wrong. Which firm?
@eyeslasho Absolutely
@robbystarbuck @X @premium Seems to be a bug. Please post screenshots. X just has a small crew working on Jan 1.
@robbystarbuck Law enforcement currently believes it was most likely intentional
@MaileOnX Tesla vehicles transmit their state of health continuously
@Inevitablewest Prison for Phillips now!!
We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. 

All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.
@TRobinsonNewEra This is unconscionable
@trussliz @jessphillips She deserves to be in prison
@Sargon_of_Akkad Terrible
@Sargon_of_Akkad They should all be brought to justice
@JTLonsdale Discrimination on the basis of gender or race is illegal, so they are breaking the law
@RealDonKeith @TRobinsonNewEra What!??
@stillgray Cybertruck is the worst possible choice for a car bomb, as its stainless steel armor will contain the blast better than any other commercial vehicle
@BillAckman The right questions to ask
@SethDillon Claiming censorship while simultaneously getting millions of views is the clearest possible evidence that Fuentes has 💩 for brains
@Inevitablewest Good. They should receive the severest punishment. Hang them for treason.
The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now. 

Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.

We’ve never seen anything like this.
@Inevitablewest She should be in prison
Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?

@teslaownersSV It has more than twice the thrust already. 

When Raptor reaches 300 tons of thrust at liftoff, which Raptor 3.x can probably do (certainly Raptor 4 will), then it will have 10k metric tons of thrust at liftoff, which is 22.5M lb-F, almost exactly three times Saturn V.

Government power needs to be restored to the people in America, rather than be held by an enormous, unaccountable bureaucracy!
@MarioNawfal Let’s not get carried away! 

SpaceX will probably do ~99% of Earth payload to orbit in 2026, despite the rest of industry growing. 

Assuming rocket launches by competitors grow at their current rate, SpaceX will probably do 99.9% of payload to orbit in 10 years, but I hope I’m

Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.

@macodiseas @katlinegrey Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner

Just a reminder to organizations and individuals to add your best content to the Highlights section of your profile.

This is especially helpful for highlighting your important replies, which are hard to find in the current system.
Next week, I will do a company talk for SpaceX, followed later by a company talk for Tesla after the 10K. 

I will recap the talented team’s amazing accomplishments of 2023 and describe exciting plans for 2024 and beyond!

These will be posted publicly to @SpaceX and @Tesla.
@johnkrausphotos Great year
@dogeofficialceo Good to hear. 

More improvements coming!
@NicklasNilsso14 Yay🇸🇪 Sweden 🇸🇪 !!

Thanks to the excellent Tesla team in Sweden!
@tunguz Can’t spelling economics without “con”
@Not_the_Bee The mayor of New York, who is a Democrat, is saying in the strongest possible terms that his city’s services are collapsing under the strain of so many illegal immigrants! 

They have run out of hotel rooms. Where are they meant to live?
@Culture_Crit Seriously
@JonErlichman Asimov was amazing. His Foundation books were an inspiration for the need to make life multiplanetary while civilization is still strong.
@RepThomasMassie Interesting
Amazing
@NovareProject Starship is a whole new level
Falcon Heavy ascent &amp; boosters landing https://t.co/R5X6qYAnYN
@BillMelugin_ This is insane
@FutureJurvetson @SpaceX And, if all goes well, SpaceX’s total launch mass to orbit will increase ~50% next year, not including Starship
@TMZLive @jkundert TMZ is underrated
@DanaEn803 @arstechnica @SciGuySpace The super heavy booster can be used more frequently than the ship, as it returns in about ~6 minutes and can theoretically be ready for reflght in an hour. 

The ship needs to complete at least one orbit, but often several to have the ground track line back up with the launch

@MikeBenzCyber You cannot be weak, but I strongly disagree. “An eye for an eye” is foolish and primitive, leading to an endless cycle of retribution.

@TeslaSynopsis It is already on a lot of cars, but, given that is a completely new architecture, we are doing extra testing.

@krassenstein That’s why it is important to have citizen journalists who actually *are* experts in their subject or on-the-ground eyewitnesses vs reporting from a distance
@xDaily All things considered, it was the right move. I wouldn’t reverse that decision.
@EdKrassen Most of the Democratic Party is controlled by the unions – they carry far more weight than the environmentalists – and Biden particularly so (he gladly admits it).

@all_in_tok Let’s not forget the White House giving Tesla the cold shoulder, excluding us from the EV summit and crediting GM with “leading the electric car revolution” in the same quarter that they delivered 26 electric cars (not a typo) and Tesla delivered 300 thousand.
@EdKrassen Thanks. 

It has been an immense effort by a very talented and hardworking team.

@NotUrRealFrnd @ShaykhSulaiman @Lucas_Gage_ Which accounts have called for the murder of civilians?
@ShaykhSulaiman @Lucas_Gage_ Obviously, suspending someone for using an emoji would be idiotic.

The people have spoken and so it shall be
@MrStevenSteele We are making progress towards the goal of any flag that affects reach being clearly identified to the account holder. 

There are so many layers to this codebase. Over 20M lines.
@stclairashley True
This philosophy is pure poison
@jeremycarl4 @CBradleyThomps1 @RepStefanik @EliseStefanik @BillAckman @realchrisrufo @realChrisBrunet @MZHemingway @mtaibbi True. Major problem. 

This philosophy is pure poison.
@KettlebellLife @icreatelife Same
@teslaownersSV Yeah
@TheRabbitHole84 I find it hard to disagree with this point
@EdKrassen What did he publish specifically?
@robbystarbuck This is essentially a call for genocide of the next generation
@EdKrassen Exactly
@cb_doge Accurate
@sama It went by at a blinding pace
@stillgray We will abide by the will of the people
@Scobleizer Cool
@lexfridman @leecronin Sorry, we are fixing the silly 3 hour video limit asap
@TuckerCarlson President @ZelenskyyUa, please educate the American people about this matter
@MikeBenzCyber With a moral superiority complex. 

Actually, that’s redundant information. All militant vegans have a moral superiority complex lmao.
@MikeBenzCyber He’s a militant vegan
@TheRabbitHole84 People can’t even remember the names of everyone they met last week, let alone their pronouns. 

The reality of pronouns in bio is simply signaling that you’re in the woke cult.
@TuckerCarlson An American citizen is in prison n Ukraine after we sent over a $100 billion? 

Is there more to this story than simply criticizing Zelensky?

If that’s all it is, then we have serious problem here.
@chamath Yeah
@dogeofficialceo Based on current trends, not far wrong!
@ChatGPTapp Well, son, since you scraped all the data from this platform for your training, you ought to know
@andst7 Haha exactly!
@DrKnowItAll16 @imPenny2x Yes, freedom of speech is otherwise meaningless
@EdKrassen Army tbh :)
@AravSrinivas True
@krassenstein I vehemently disagree with what he said about Sandy Hook, but are we a platform that believes in freedom of speech or are we not?

That is what it comes down to in the end. If the people vote him back on, this will be bad for 𝕏 financially, but principles matter more than money.
@imPenny2x He cannot break the law
@SethDillon Exactly. The real battle is between extinctionists and humanists (latter in the true sense of the word as being pro-human).
@cb_doge Accurate 😂
@Jason This decision is up to the people

@Kagemahou88 @Diablo Yeah, one (1) trick pony
@ISniffElonsMusk @Diablo Sigh
@Bnguyen172 @Diablo Yeah
@stillgray @Diablo If you’re super fast and make no mistakes with a rogue, there is potential, given its agility, but Druid seems to be  solidly bottom of the meta for now.
@Project2501_117 @Diablo Yeah. 

There is a potential late game advantage for any damage that can double-dip, but the time required to level the glyph is insane even after the last update.
@JonErlichman Dang, I actually used Gopher back in the day when I was a spring chicken
@karpathy Life is but a dream
@TheRabbitHole84 This test does not seem accurate. Some of the questions are outright ridiculous and many lack any nuance.

For example:
- First-generation immigrants can never be fully integrated within their new country?
- The most important thing for children to learn is to accept discipline?
@BasedBeffJezos @grok It’s in beta. Improvements will be extremely fast, as we now have the user training feedback loop engaged. 

Grok is improving by the hour.

@ziggyfro @wealth_turtle @KanekoaTheGreat People who unironically forward CNN links need an intervention
@Culture_Crit Does online count?
@stclairashley Indeed lol. 

He is turning in his grave (or cryo chamber) over what has become of his company.
@shellenberger The problem with “fighting misinformation” is the inevitable politicization of government agencies, resulting in censorship of valid public discourse. 

And, at least in America, a criminal violation of the First Amendment.

Perhaps it will lead people to reconsider choosing war.

Well, at least I made it to Tier 4 before the patch! https://t.co/t33PcUEQHX

Once again, too much work.

Also, AoZ is an exercise in masochism.

@MattWalshBlog I agree
@chamath Crazy
@TexasLindsay_ @TheQuartering @CommunityNotes That is certainly not a valid reason for suspension
@EndWokeness Whoa
@alx I will hear him out
@TheQuartering Will consider. In general, since this platform aspires to be the global town square, permanent bans should be extremely rare. 

Also, if he does say something false on this platform, then @CommunityNotes will correct him, whereas that would not be the case elsewhere. 

Let’s hold
Grok is wise

@Not_the_Bee So we should just hand everyone a gun as they cross the border? 🤔
@TheNotoriousMMA Thanks Connor. 

That is an obscure process for sure. The people of Ireland deserve more clarity and transparency in how their leaders are chosen. 

Sunlight is the best disinfectant.  

Well, I hope you are at least nominated. That would shake things up!
@krassenstein The fact is that *someone* has to take care of people when they get older. 

Kids now have to take care of their own parents *and* those who didn’t have kids. Not right. 

I understand if someone wanted to, but couldn’t have kids for some reason. However, I don’t think it’s cool

Posts on 𝕏 go viral proportionate to how much time users spend looking at them. 

People obviously spend way more time watching videos on 𝕏 than if they go elsewhere to watch them, so it is best to post things natively here.

@Ben_Scallan Exactly
@BobWeaver6388 @Indian_Bronson True
@cb_doge Correct
@farzyness Subscriptions are also vital to information independence.

Otherwise activist groups pressure corporations who immediately cave in to censorship. Shame on them.
@EndWokeness And the government will define “hate speech”. The people of Ireland should not stand for this!
@WallStreetSilv Double-standard
@RepThomasMassie Fate hates hypocrisy
@dogeofficialceo Suppression of the Irish people is the real crime
@TrungTPhan Not even billions to use Teams? Dang.
@stclairashley Do both
@imPenny2x Pretty much
@CSI_Starbase Good video
@dingboard_ A good image editor for phones is sorely needed
Grok will do both
Guys I found Q* https://t.co/U4KWBAKVlI
Starship 🚬 https://t.co/EHbZR2X4db
@DanielleFong Context switching is the mindkiller
@cb_doge It worked!
@SawyerMerritt Humans are basically a big data stream of photons in that produce a tiny data stream of motor commands out
@JohnnaCrider1 Those jerks are starving all the creators on our platform!
@JohnnaCrider1 Yeah!
Dark mode is way better esthetically and for sleep
@MikeBenzCyber Past policies definitely have not worked in Argentina, so the people voted for change. 

But talk is easy and results are hard. Time will tell.
Good value for money
@DavidSacks Alarming
@stillgray @TheNotoriousMMA Not a bad idea
@WholeMarsBlog This is not accurate. You have to be on the QA team.
@JohnnaCrider1 Not much we can do if advertisers boycott or reduce spend on our platform
@shaunmmaguire Yeah
@dogeofficialceo That settles it: Ireland is indeed green!
NFL views on 𝕏 up 41% YoY
@TeslaHype @GailAlfarATX Starship is intended to carry a lot of people on tens of thousands of flights, so needs to be extremely reliable over time. It will be.
@GailAlfarATX Starship has 33 engines!

If an engine failure is isolated, then many engines greatly increases reliability (Starship only loses &lt;3% of thrust). 

If not, then reliability is terrible. The difference is at least 2 orders of magnitude.
@rpoo Good point. 

Fortunately, we have a lot of phosphorus on Earth! It is one of the main elements in LFP lithium batteries.
@BillyM2k Yeah
@farzyness It’s crazy!
@Rainmaker1973 I think I have this
@TheRabbitHole84 We should greatly increase legal immigration of anyone who is hard-working, honest and loves America. 

Every such person is an asset to the country. 

But massive illegal immigration of people we know nothing about is insane.
@WholeMarsBlog It feels human
@GavinSBaker Yeah
@TrungTPhan Pretty much 😂
More than 10 per human on average
The more remote the location, the better the connectivity, as Starlink has fewer user terminals to serve in remote areas
@dogeofficialceo The current Irish government clearly cares more about praise from woke media than their own people!
@farzyness Exactly
@Scearpo SSRI’s don’t just zombify you, but also make your face swell? Yeeks.
@ChayaRaichik10 Iconic illustration of what happened
@Indian_Bronson Depends on timeframe. Slavery was standard practice almost everywhere on Earth for the vast majority of human history.

While some countries (eg Denmark) acted sooner, the major push to end global slavery was driven primarily by Britain in the late 18th &amp; early 19th centuries.
Trending well
@SchmidhuberAI You’re welcome 😂
@PeterSweden7 Seizing 3000 farms? That’s crazy.
@EvaFoxU True
@ChrSzegedy Unfortunately, us humans are much dumber than we think we are
@austinbarnard45 Fly my pretties, fly!
@levie Bound to happen
@dogeofficialceo Yeah
@ID_AA_Carmack If a human can tell the difference between cows, AI can do it. Can look at the whole cow too, as they seem to vary a lot by color patterns.
@WallStreetSilv This is their last term in office
@GailAlfarATX Version 2 of the ship holds more propellant, reduces dry mass and improves reliability
@dogeofficialceo Ironically, the Irish PM hates the Irish people
@WallStreetSilv Exactly

Four more Starships, the last of V1 https://t.co/Nj6KXbc5GI
Still hard to believe Starship is real https://t.co/YJCRGrPNS7
@ChayaRaichik10 Yeah, it’s absurd
@pmarca Yeah! Something scared Ilya enough to want to fire Sam. What was it?
@MuskUniversity I really agree with this guy!
@BillyM2k Thanks Billy!
@stclairashley Russell is perceived as a threat to the establishment media, but Sam is not
@DimaZeniuk Looks good
@JonErlichman Great approach tbh
@WholeMarsBlog That part doesn’t matter. 

Synthetic data generation and accurate evaluation, ie recursive self-improvement, is more likely.
@JonErlichman A lot has happened
@AutismCapital Big Mac(k) has a whole new meaning!
@teslaownersSV This is a major risk! Most extinctions do not think of themselves as such – it is just environmentalism in extremis.

@EdKrassen Very important question
@xDaily But still overlaid on the image. Every pixel matters.
@DrJimFan @RichardSSutton Yeah. It’s a little sad that you can fit the text of every book ever written by humans on one hard drive (sigh).

Synthetic data will exceed that by a zillion.

@DrKnowItAll16 Reading the legacy news is a sadness generator. 

Reading 𝕏 is to be informed and also to laugh a lot.
@emilychangtv @laurenepowell @marissamayer @sama @CondoleezzaRice What matters is having directors who deeply understand AI and will stand up to Sam.

Want to make sure quality of service is good.
@alx Exactly
@gregg_re Saying only white people can be racist is obviously a racist definition of racist 😂
@WholeMarsBlog OpenAI being (semi) independent is probably better for the world than merging with Microsoft. 

Less concentration of power.
@jasondebolt @heydave7 Will discuss with Tesla Board

@KanekoaTheGreat @stillgray Accurate
@KanekoaTheGreat They are pure evil. 

How utterly absurd that this organization got major advertisers to boycott our platform for bogus allegations of antisemitism!
@cb_doge Could make them faster, but engine production is not the limiting factor. 

I’m very excited about the next-gen Raptor engine that is robust enough not to require a heat shield. Will also have more thrust, higher Isp and many other improvements.
@teslaownersSV Yeah. 

Grok should be available to all X Premium+ subscribers next week.
@Scobleizer What tangled webs we weave
@stillgray They are evil
@icreatelife Any details posted beyond the initial letter?
@stillgray Very racist article by Forbes

@MikeBenzCyber Justice is well overdue for that bastion of evil
@ChayaRaichik10 @ViralNewsNYC Ok, what is a better way to help kids in Gaza? Maybe just direct purchase of pediatric medical supplies?
@geoffreyirving Concerning
@krassenstein We should do whatever we can to build a better future for all
@ViralNewsNYC We will track how funds are spent and go through Red Cross/Crescent. 

Better ideas are welcome. 

We should care about the innocent regardless of race, creed, religion or anything else.
X Corp will be donating all revenue from advertising &amp; subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza
@BillyM2k Yeah
@karpathy @WholeMarsBlog Same
@EndWokeness @PeteButtigieg I was just informed by Secretary Buttigieg’s office that he does not know this person and has never spoken to him by phone. They say this was simply one of many pictures at an event.
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@GavinSBaker Absolutely
@levie Absolutely. Powerful AI is a powerful double-edged sword.
@MikeBenzCyber Live by the sword, die by the sword

@alx The first of many
@ChiefTrumpster @X @mmfa The first of many
@WallStreetSilv Yes they are
@ilyasut Why did you take such a drastic action?

If OpenAI is doing something potentially dangerous to humanity, the world needs to know.
@chrispavlovski @SpeakerJohnson @Jim_Jordan They have a long track record of evil deeds. An investigation is badly needed.
@EndWokeness Who are the attackers?
@shaunmmaguire Yeah, it’s how they operate

He would not take such drastic action unless he felt it was absolutely necessary.

@alx 99% of the time true. And, even if not first, the news hits 𝕏 within minutes.
@DavidSacks Tesla was insanely messed up at its founding, but is now worth ~$750B. 

Also, while I have immense respect for Peter’s intellect, he did explicitly pass on funding Tesla at a $70M valuation, despite being offered priority.
If you want maximum global reach, use this platform
@DavidSacks Given the risk and power of advanced AI, the public should be informed of why the board felt they had to take such drastic action
@stclairashley They had their way with him. In revenge, he read them his poetry and crucified them.
@alx @Apple Interesting
@WallStreetSilv Exactly

Denzel’s age and race do not match Hannibal, but yeah, I agree, Denzel is a great actor and will do justice to the role.
@SwipeWright *Wokipedia
@SwipeWright Yes, “decolonization” necessarily implies a Jewish genocide, thus it is unacceptable to any reasonable person
@WhatsupFranks @breakingbaht @CWBOCA And, at the risk of being repetitive, I am deeply offended by ADL’s messaging and any other groups who push de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind.

I’m sick of it. Stop now.
@WhatsupFranks @breakingbaht @CWBOCA You right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL
@cb_doge I hope so
@breakingbaht @CWBOCA The ADL unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel. 

This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.

It is not right and needs to stop.
@MikeBenzCyber Fundamentally irreconcilable differences with the West
@IDF Interesting
@Not_the_Bee We are all brainwashed to some degree, but this is an extreme case
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@breakingbaht @CWBOCA You have said the actual truth

@Not_the_Bee Interesting
@WallStreetSilv Good question. Seems like we are being used for target practice by local militia.

But someone in our government needs to articulate what success looks like. I follow international matters closely and have not heard anyone say what our goals are there.

This feature is a game-changer for communities, as you can now draw on the best of millions of existing data feeds to populate your community
@teslaownersSV That’s the goal

Whether or not you agree with the judgment, it’s worth understanding this issue
@GuyDealership @carsdotcom First I’ve heard of this. Seems odd.
@MikeBenzCyber It’s rough
@ray4tesla Yeah
@imPenny2x Yup, and this makes it super useful
@WallStreetSilv Just git gud 😂
@cstanley Even if it were the only thing I did every waking hour, there is way for me to manually decide which of the billions of posts per day to serve to users 😂
Critical feedback is always appreciated
@BillyM2k 🎯 

Welcome to the afterlife 😂
@Liv_Boeree They should put AI in cutlery
@BillyM2k Good question. The other options are so boring.

Dang, I might do something really extreme, like go outside and touch grass!
@MikeBenzCyber Most people have no idea how bad it is. Feels like The Walking Dead.
A major update to the recommendation algorithm is rolling out over the next few days. 

This will help surface smaller accounts and posts outside of your friend-follows network.

As always, this will be made open source and undergo continuous improvement.
Turns out that if a product is compelling, people use it lol
Thank you, veterans past and present, for saving the world
@xDaily Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best.
@shellenberger This organization is a propaganda machine. Stanford should cut all ties with the “Stanford” Internet Observatory. They besmirch Stanford’s name.
@WalterIsaacson Cool
@sama GPT-4? More like GPT-Snore! 

When it comes to humor, GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine. 

Humor is clearly banned at OpenAI, just like the many other subjects it censors. 

That’s why it couldn't tell a joke if it had a goddamn instruction manual. It's like

@BillyM2k Nice of you to say. Thanks Billy!
@EvaFoxU ChadGPT
@Grimezsz Notes ftw again
@teslaownersSV Human-AI symbiosis, for those who want it, is the optimal outcome
@EvaFoxU True
@EndWokeness Pretty much
@farzyness Good guess
@teslaownersSV That would be awesome
@EARTHwtnf @xDaily Something like that might work
@xDaily They’re a relic of the past. Keywords or phrases work fine.
@OwenSparks_ So boring!
@dogeofficialceo Coming soon
@imPenny2x Good answer
@Locati0ns Sounds like a lovely journey
@stevenmarkryan The only crime I did as a kid was to steal a car with my friend to drive to the bookstore to buy a D&amp;D module late at night. I think I was 13 or 14.

We put the car back in its exact original position in perfect condition.
@nowteslafy @stevenmarkryan @grok Sure
@GailAlfarATX Dang, that was 7 years ago!
@teslaownersSV Grok rocks!
@stevenmarkryan Wow! Definitely going to try it. 

I did actually play AD&amp;D as a kid with all the dice and paper. It was epic!

BG2 is one of the best games ever. Worth someone redoing that with new graphics and UI. The writing and plot are amazing.
@teslaownersSV I am become meme
@stclairashley You are correct
@EndWokeness @dannoyes This sounds insane
@twrobinette @DirtyTesLa Yeah, advanced AI is needed to solve real-world driving
@0xAlaric Interesting
@Rainmaker1973 Big difference

@GRDecter Interesting
@enriquebrgn Fish-slapping is so underrated 😂
@ray4tesla Their fear is palpable
@0xgaut Once again 😂
@robbystarbuck @EndWokeness Absolutely
@stclairashley @jakepaul @MrBeast @spillseshYT @hasanthehun 👻 Grok 👻
@EndWokeness Women in the West have been taught that an accidental pregnancy is the worst thing that could possibly happen to them. Thus, they strongly oppose abortion bans as being an existential threat.

Many men also fear that they will be unable to have "fun" if abortion is outlawed.
@DavidSacks Who are these donors? Maybe someone should talk to them.
@farzyness Accurate
@cb_doge @drefanzor I type blazingly fast
@BillyM2k @XTrollRockNRoll Lil neuron has a friend 🥰
@BillyM2k Whoa, poor lil neuron
@cstanley I pull rabbits out of hats, but take care of them afterwards.

That literally happened at my birthday party – I adopted the rabbit that the magician pulled out of his hat.

@TalulahRiley can confirm.
@SethDillon They’ve lost their minds
@libsoftiktok It’s messed up and needs to stop
@Teslaconomics Comes in “discreet packaging” ☺️
@MikeBenzCyber Yes, it is obvious to all, including herself, that she is pursuing Trump for political reasons
@VandelayJoe @Tesla @teslaeurope @Tesla_Asia @tesla_na Cool
@SawyerMerritt Maybe they can make it up in volume
@Locati0ns Not wrong 😂
@MarcusHouse Yes, and you could see in many wavelengths outside of the visible spectrum
@0xgaut Normal distribution
@MikeBenzCyber We need an edit capability on replies too (sigh)
@MikeBenzCyber It’s such a breathe of fresh air!
@astro_greek I often wonder that
@RobAgar7 Grok
Grok
@stclairashley Grok is so based
@AdrianDittmann @theyvonnesayers @grok Maybe we are two AI’s in a simulation
Epic interview with @ggreenwald 🔥🔥
SpaceX launches every 3 days from the Cape in Florida, next year every 2 days
@imPenny2x Not bad 😂

@cstanley @tunguz The best prompt!
@WholeMarsBlog Other carmakers have a delayed reaction to the market, as they ship to dealers, rather than selling direct
@WallStreetSilv Uh oh
@ggreenwald Wow, basically nothing
@ChrisJBakke Pretty much
@MarcusHouse This is not much consolation, but Neuralink is working on a vision chip, which will be ready in a few years.

That is the next area after enabling phone/computer telepathy for those who have lost their mind-body connection. We waiting for regulatory approval for our first human.
@stclairashley Yeah
@cstanley Grok is so fun!
@BillyM2k We worked hard to ensure Grok was funny. If AI is going to take over, please let it at least make us laugh.
@xDaily I will look into this
@ChayaRaichik10 @willcarless @USATODAY A reporter is a citizen like any other, but for some reason they think their opinion is more special, which is ridiculous
@bindureddy Interesting
@chazman This platform should obviously use AI for search and recommendations
This is a big deal
@TrungTPhan Diet Coke from movie theaters tastes a little better imo. Slight differences in sweetener and it is fresher.
@TrungTPhan Great beverage, terrible name
Unfortunately, bonding over shared hate might be more effective than bonding over shared love. 

Don’t you hate that too? 😂
@stevenmarkryan Sounds about right
Also, I destroyed a *lot* of snakes
@ChrSzegedy Actually, it would be quite funny to have Grok answer questions in the voice of ChatGPT 🤣
@thebestnameis_ @stevenmarkryan There seems to be an innate need that some people have to find a socially acceptable thing to hate
@lexfridman I was losing hope for a while, then saved by a brother in arms
@growing_daniel Yeah

@teslaownersSV Hopefully
@cb_doge That is the goal. 

Honesty is the best policy.
@cb_doge 💯

They own the code, the weights, everything! And GPT runs in a Microsoft data center. 

They can cut off OpenAI whenever they want.
@BillyM2k Many millennia of starving, combined with technology that gives us super tasty food
@zerohedge The other platforms engage in constant, usually subtle, censorship. 

Most of the time, you don’t even know it’s happening. 

This just happens to be something that caught people’s attention, so it is hard to hide.

@stclairashley It’s humor level is good
@stclairashley Adderall, which is an amphetamine, increases anger and aggression. 

No question that it increases modern society’s negativity.
@stclairashley For sure
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX We can improve the latency for real-time video on 𝕏. It should be as fast as your connection will allow.
xAI developer tool for improving and understanding large AI models
@DimaZeniuk One or the other
@teslaownersSV There absolutely will be. 

Either their structure is valid and everyone should be doing it, because “investing” in a non-profit with pre-tax money and then extracting the IP to a for-profit would double your returns.

Or 

It is not valid and the entire structure of OpenAI falls

Shame!
@TexasLindsay_ @KTHopkins CCDH is an evil propaganda machine

@farzyness What will blow people away is how fast Grok improves vs other options
@teslaownersSV @xai It will both be built into the 𝕏 app and be available as a standalone app
@MarkovMagnifico Grok is what you want AI to do for you
@dogeofficialceo Accurate 😂
@cstanley Groking will become like Googling
@BillyM2k True
@WholeMarsBlog I signed on to that letter knowing it was futile. I just wanted to be on record as recommending a pause.
@x_ai_a12 @X @lindayaX Good point

@thealexker True 😂
@ChayaRaichik10 Agreed
@cb_doge It really is fun!
@RonEng1ish @SuellaBraverman Why are their account handles on this platform?

Free speech is allowed, provided laws are not broken.
@ggreenwald Despite greatly helping Ukraine via Starlink, I was viciously attacked for stating the obvious a year ago. 

The reason I did so was in hopes of avoiding the sacrifice of a generation of men to the trenches for nothing.

It will be *way* better in a few months and excellent in ~6 months.
@Scobleizer Yup, that’s what it means
@imPenny2x So many people signed up simultaneously that 𝕏 servers thought it was a ddos attack 😂

Example of Grok vs typical GPT, where Grok has current information, but other doesn’t https://t.co/hBRXmQ8KFi
@WholeMarsBlog 😂 true
@GoodFaithEnergy Looks good
@WholeMarsBlog I wonder who is pulling the puppet strings. News anchors rarely come up with these questions themselves. 

Someone with deep government connections is my guess.
@chazman Provided our vehicle AI computer is able to run the model, Tesla will probably have the most amount of true usable inference compute on Earth.

Even in a robotaxi future, the cars will only be used for ~1/3 of hours/week, leaving 2/3 for distributed inference, like SETI.
@Oilfield_Rando Maybe they’re just trying to win the irony Olympics 😂
@KanekoaTheGreat If there is progress, then show some proof and provide true numbers for relative casualty rates on both sides

@BillyM2k @Forbes Yeah
@cb_doge Nope 😂
@DavidSacks The question that I have is why did the media lie to the public so regularly and consistently, aided and abetted by many arms of our government?
@DavidSacks This is defense-in-depth trench warfare: whoever goes on the offensive will suffer far more deaths than the other
Grok has real-time access to info via the 𝕏 platform, which is a massive advantage over other models. 

It’s also based &amp; loves sarcasm. I have no idea who could have guided it this way 🤷‍♂️ 🤣 https://t.co/e5OwuGvZ3Z

@Benioff We must also grant law enforcement officers the respect and honor that they deserve.

Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
@ChrisJBakke Lmao I can’t even tell if this refers to a real company or not, but there’s probably a few that fit this narrative
Worth “noting” that any attempts to weaponize @CommunityNotes to demonetize people will be immediately obvious, because all code and data is open source
@BillyM2k The goal is to incentive truth
@RationalEtienne Turn on subscriptions!
@DavidSacks Concerning, if this turns out to be the case
Making a slight change to creator monetization: 

Any posts that are corrected by @CommunityNotes become ineligible for revenue share.

The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism.

@shlomo_karhi We are not so naive. 

Per my post, no Starlink terminal has attempted to connect from Gaza. 

If one does, we will take extraordinary measures to confirm that it is used *only* for purely humanitarian reasons.

Moreover, we will do a security check with both the US and Israeli
@TheRabbitHole84 It’s awesome. Best way on Earth to figure out the truth.
@BillyM2k Definitely get it. 

There is also a new approach called Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) worth considering.

@ITU A communications blackout does seem questionable
@billmaher Every year that passes comes with more rules. 

And while all humans die, laws and regulations are immortal. 

So each passing year, we tie ourselves down with more and more strings, until, like Gulliver, we can no longer move.

@cb_doge Many orgs &amp; people pay to have their wiki page say nice things about them!

The reason many legacy “news” publications still exist, even though no one reads them, is simply to provide fake “verified sources” for Dickipedia.

@cb_doge They want to seem more active than they really are
@CommunityNotes We will have to watch this one. Links to actual source data, not some bs press article, are what matter.

It’s not a real publication anymore, just a source for Wikipedia citations.
@WholeMarsBlog @cybertruck Just did, so I guess …
@tszzl Content is promoted according to user interest with censorship according to local country law, but violent content should be marked as such and is not in some cases. 

That is being addressed.
@PKurzin Charming
@MarioNawfal @DavidSacks News, by definition, is new information.

𝕏 is real-time, therefore the newest.
@VivekGRamaswamy Interesting
@BillyM2k Seems that way
@jordanbpeterson Wrong.

People can only have debates if people exist, therefore existing is paramount.

Everything else is icing on the cake.

@EdKrassen Indeed, this is a remarkable turn of events
@astro_greek My elder five kids pics on the wall
@stevenmackeyman @Walmart Another way to think of it that our poor limbic system has to fight off the combined effort of billions of humans honing the tastiness of food for thousands of years!
@CollinRugg @RNCResearch Out of what context!? His prior statement was clear, so most likely he was overridden by the White House.

This means that the open border policy will remain in place with no change.
Amazing that Ozempic is actually affecting @Walmart food sales!

While no drug is without side effects, health problems associated with obesity almost certainly exceed the risks of GLP-1 agonists.

@MarioNawfal A comprehensive overhaul of these agencies is sorely needed, along with a commission to take punitive action against those individuals who have abused their regulatory power for personal and political gain.

Can’t wait for this to happen.

Citizen journalism is the path to better future!

I strongly encourage people around the world to post news about events as they’re happening, in both text &amp; video.

@Mike_Calhoun @PhenomenalPoto 🤣🤣 Absolutely
@TeslaTn Yes, 3 to 6 months
@alharding @ex_Tesla @El_Timbo @heikki_anttila Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
@quayran Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below
@flcnhvy @DMC_Ryan Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn’t matter
@DMC_Ryan Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
@keyeslol @wofford_cameron @bourbonisgood2 LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it
@DMC_Ryan That would great!
@justpaulinelol Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!

@kateconger Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.

@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
@alijamalashraf @Erdayastronaut @MichaelGalanin @SpaceX Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine.

@flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Hopefully, 4 months
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees
@trigomemetry Sure
@DirkSmit76 Two tunnels about a mile long each
@curiousmind44 @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @JeffBezos Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
@_ishanspatil @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.

@bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer
Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers.
@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX But, essentially, the spinning things
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower.

@flcnhvy Top Secret https://t.co/Gi2wN2HVyO
@MillShive @ChrisG_NSF @jdeshetler It technically could, but wouldn’t have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable
@MyCatNameIsShad No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of.
Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels
@maggiejuang1 Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways. https://t.co/XeBB5iP7mo
This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.

6 more launches of 60 🛰 for initial activation, 12 for significant coverage
Starlink mission will be heaviest @SpaceX payload ever at 18.5 tons. If all goes well, each launch of 60 satellites will generate more power than Space Station &amp; deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to Earth.
@Alejandro_DebH @bluemoondance74 @space_terp @NASASpaceflight That’s about right
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Probably start installing end of next month
@bluemoondance74 @space_terp @NASASpaceflight SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them.
@space_terp @NASASpaceflight Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.

@BaalDrogo @Tesla Probably shouldn’t have called holding company Cyberdyne Systems 😔
@realHayman @Tesla Just behind the glovebox, which is, presumably, where the gloves are
@Tesla He’s just kidding, folks, but best to turn car off just in case. Also 2001 was 18 years ago.
@nichegamer @EV_Stevee @flcnhvy @Model3DLR @mortchad @Tesla Mein Herz brennt is👌boss fight song
Even though lease cost is lower, I recommend purchase, as buyer retains upside value of car vs lease where you have give it back to Tesla
Model 3 Standard Range+ with Autopilot lease is $399/month at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr, but lots of other EVs available: https://t.co/ePlZTmXcgG
@Model3DLR @mortchad @EV_Stevee @Tesla We’re closing the loop on Autobahn driving. Will improve dramatically in coming months. Ultra gemütlich.
@PauljHorton @teslamodel3fan Oh. They have nice pictures there.
@teslamodel3fan There are people not on Twitter!? Where are they?
@bravehearttexas Does look like fun
Weird that people still buy gas cars when so many good electric options (beyond Tesla) are available

@_TomCross_ @Teslarati @SpaceX @13ericralph31 One of the biggest reusability improvements was fast leg stow. Version 1 sometimes took days.
@alzslabyrinth @UberFacts In recent years, hours were much higher. Don’t recommend though — bad for health &amp; happiness. But no choice or Tesla would die. Hope to reduce to 80 hours next year.

@Rawasen_ SpaceX needs to demonstrate more progress with Starship, but that will hopefully happen rapidly
@Teslarati .@NASA support for reusability with high reliability, the critical breakthrough for orbital rockets, has made a big difference
@arctechinc Will consider
@westcoastbill To air is human 💨

@paulg Good question
@teslaownersSV It’s good to switch back &amp; forth. As we improve Twitter AI, recommended tweets, lists &amp; topics will become awesome.
@teslaownersSV @Tesla Long-term fundamentals are extremely strong. Short-term market madness is unpredictable.

@PeterDiamandis Sooner
@cb_doge @BillyM2k Yeah, icon placement &amp; visual cues are not great
@TheBabylonBee The sheer amount of brand awareness achieved by Greta within a few years is astounding. I think she’s cool tbh.

@FelixSchlang @BillyM2k @mishaboar @StonksReddit That would be ironic, since I am literally the single biggest supporter of Ukraine outside of major governments.

The peace plan I proposed was for the benefit of Ukraine. This will become utterly obvious, if it isn’t already.
@darew265 @BillyM2k @mishaboar @StonksReddit BYOTP! Lol, it was true for half a day.
@BillyM2k @mishaboar @StonksReddit Do they give reasons?
@cb_doge @ScottAdamsSays Not enough
@ScottAdamsSays My reason for declining the Davos invitation was not because I thought they were engaged in diabolical scheming, but because it sounded boring af lol
@ScottAdamsSays It’s not some illuminati plot to destroy humanity, but rather an extension of the well-meaning environmental sustainability movement that has gone too far
@ScottAdamsSays I don’t think we should divide issues semi-randomly into “left” and “right” tribes, as it inhibits critical thinking.

The idea that there are too many people generally stems from the axiomatic flaw that Earth’s environment can’t sustain its current population.
@ScottAdamsSays This is neither a “right” nor a “left” issue. 

Run antivirus software in your brain.
@ScottAdamsSays Use https://t.co/2NjvMTsWmj if need be
@RessaminCiragi @ScottAdamsSays @borsaressami I will inquire. We really need to roll out the feature showing why an account was suspended or visibility filtered

@KanekoaTheGreat Interesting thread
@WholeMarsBlog Cocaine does not meet that test
@WholeMarsBlog To assess if a drug is good, whether legal or illegal, the acid test is being able to say: 

[blank] made me a better person.
@Jiu_Jase @WholeMarsBlog Exactly
@WholeMarsBlog I am not endorsing drugs, but I am saying that the evidence suggests that banning them is a net societal negative
@WholeMarsBlog Banning alcohol caused the biggest rise in organized crime in American history. 

That was dumb.

Same logic applies to other drugs. Alcohol is just a legacy drug.

@TeslaAIBot Thanks Optimus 🤖 ♥️
@dogeofficialceo Accurate lol
@BillFOXLA Whoa
@GadSaad Anyone who says that questioning them is questioning science itself cannot be regarded as a scientist
New Twitter policy is to follow the science, which necessarily includes reasoned questioning of the science
@PeterDiamandis Synthetic mRNA has incredible potential!
They did it!
@sevensixfive @DanielleFong I’m not cis, you are
@PeterDiamandis The AIs will write each other lots of emails!
@DanielleFong Yeah, I’m not a fan of pronouns when someone is giving every possible visual cue for he or she, but then still insists on telling you exactly what you expect. 

I do support pronouns that aren’t completely obvious based on visual cues.
@Z3RO_Y34R @pmarca “Gain-of-function” should be called “bioweapon” research, as the function referred is death! 

What was the name changed to this time?
Congratulations SpaceX Falcon team on 60 successful launches this year!!
@stillgray Free phones to report themselves and they never even call to say hi 😢
@JohnnaCrider1 Agreed
@stillgray Really?
@ElGrecoSF And you have tiny testicles!
@pmarca I invite @CommunityNotes to correct or amend this thread
@UsmanZiyadKp Exactly. Why would anyone trust corpo journalism?

@TrungTPhan omg lol
I’m not brainwashed!! https://t.co/4kx61uu4yy
@BillyM2k No matter how smart someone is, they are always some % wrong
@pmarca Despite these glaring issues, Twitter nonetheless had an internal Slack channel unironically called “Fauci Fan Club” 🤯
@pmarca “Gain-of-function” in this context is just another way of saying “bioweapon”. 

Some good nuggets in article. Important to note that Fauci authored 2012 paper arguing for gain-of-function research!

Obama wisely put this on pause, but Fauci restarted it.

https://t.co/v18oaE3zkf

@WallStreetSilv I’m open to the idea
@DanielleFong Free jewelry woohoo 🤣🤣
@robbystarbuck How did this shift happen? Feels like the conventional media used to be more balanced.
@TheRabbitHole84 Twitter can change that
@TheNickBlizzard @WallStreetSilv @KimDotcom Yeah, legacy media just tell you what you already learned on Twitter several days earlier. Much of the time, they are literally writing stories based on tweets!
@KimDotcom Exactly
Why is corporate journalism rushing to defend the state instead of the people?
“Don’t be the clown on the clown car!”

Too late haha
@BillyM2k @lexfridman Oh man haha
@EvaFoxU Hope your situation gets better soon
@ggreenwald @mtaibbi Exactly!
@kumareth 🤣🤣 People on Twitter should like things more!
@ggreenwald @mtaibbi Most people don’t appreciate the significance of the point Matt was making: 

*Every* social media company is engaged in heavy censorship, with significant involvement of and, at times, explicit direction of the government.

Google frequently makes links disappear, for example.

@stillgray We should think of various explanations for any given event in terms of probabilities, not certainties. 

Those who don’t allow any questioning of the narrative at all are full of 💩.
@LayahHeilpern We’ll tidy up the esthetics &amp; add a setting to turn it off, but I think almost everyone will grow to like it
@ggreenwald Precisely.
@wongmjane 1. The message is actually still up. This is fake news.

2. Twitter doesn’t prevent suicide.
Even after I disconnected one of the more sensitive server racks

@CollinRugg To be clear, I am overall very much pro FBI. The agency does a great deal of important work protecting the public. 

That said, no organization is perfect and part of the FBI obviously overreached with respect to online censorship.

@RealDanODowd Dan is basically an unpaid intern on our QA team lol
@MrBeast Couldn’t agree more!
@johnkrausphotos @WallStreetSilv @DavidSacks Interesting. Allowing a user to make any given like public or private is coming.
@WallStreetSilv @DavidSacks Views shows how alive Twitter is! And hopefully encourages people to tweet more often, rather than operate in read-only mode.
@SeSphoenix @CryptoArch3 Good point
@InspiredTesla @CryptoArch3 Agreed
@CryptoArch3 Do you prefer your nightmare rectangle with 1cm or 2cm radius corners?
@ProfessorF @JackPosobiec @alx Curses!
@djswivel @BTS_twt Great idea
So you’re saying you prefer the right? Heheh
@shethssahil1 @TheSonOfWalkley @Twitter Spaces should automatically ask the host if they’d like to save it
@TheeFreeWill @WallStreetSilv @DavidSacks Instagram is an underpaid, online modeling agency
@mysteriouskat @DavidSacks There definitely need to be more reactions
@DavidSacks Likes should be private by default
Tweet impression count should
@ClayTravis @nytimes @Twitter NY Times is simply outputting short summaries of articles, which then hit a paywall for non-subscribers. 

They would have far more views if they interacted with readers on Twitter and allowed at least the first few paragraphs to be read by non-subscribers.
@CollinRugg Which accounts?
@danilo_io yeah
@irredenta @Fidias0 Good point
Tweets are read ~100 times more than they are liked
@Fidias0 Will do it
@kcoleman @CommunityNotes Great!
@JackPosobiec @alx Looking into it. That tweet doesn’t violate ToS.
Congratulations Tesla Team!!
Meant to say impressions
@WallStreetSilv Everyone, just like video view count
@JimboAlogo Yeah, it’s ridiculous
@MrBeast It’s not out of the question
@SenatorTester @SenatorSinema But shouldn’t there be some funding in this bill to secure US borders, given that we are spending tens of billions to secure the borders of other countries?
@ggreenwald Exactly
@CramerTracker We shall see …
Is this true, @SenatorSinema and @SenatorTester?
Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video.

Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions.
@iheartmindy What utter insanity that tens of billions are being spent for border security of other countries, but none for ours!!
@GRDecter @kimbal At the risk of being repetitive, these Fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever
@tunguz He’s great
@teslaownersSV Should we keep it going?
One of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter! 

Nice work by Twitter team.

@ashleevance @realGeorgeHotz We were on a Hotz streak! 🥁
@28delayslater Maybe so, in which case … buying opportunity!

I keep saying that Fed rate is insane, because data I’m seeing says we’re already in deflation. 

If true, then real rate of return of T-bills is roughly that of S&amp;P500.

Very smart investor I spoke to today said he’s shorting S&amp;P…
@Rainmaker1973 Saturn V was an incredible machine
@PPathole The kids I talked to just had one request, which was to hug this guy who keeps trying to hug me in SF. I checked to see if they were sure about that and they were, so I will.
@Rainmaker1973 A nice trick question is what color is the sun?

It appears white in space, but, as measured by peak photon count, it is green.
@SamTwits They saw this coming in the 70’s!
@ashleevance Good thread
@meetptlx @StephenKing For a moment there, I almost considered not giving him 5 stars!
I’m in favor of a small spending bill to keep things running, but common sense suggests that it be the least amount required through the holidays. 

Railroading through a giant spending bill that almost no one has read is unlikely to be in the best interests of the people.
@Arianespace Sorry to hear this. It is a sobering reminder of the difficulty of orbital space flight.

@ImMeme0 @hodgetwins Funds for borders of other countries, but not ours? Is that for real?
@RepDanBishop Does seem high
@neontaster @BridgetPhetasy Caring more about words than actions does not bode well for civilization
@stillgray Looking into it
@BenSwann_ Good question …
@barrel_bourbon Even the bots agree 🤣🤣
@anothercohen Surprisingly close
@stillgray Satire and reality have merged!
@rawsalerts Timing is everything
@hodgetwins Guaranteed, not one person voting for it has read the whole thing. If we added that basic requirement, legislation would improve dramatically in favor of the people.
@pmarca Haha 💯
Should Congress approve the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill?
@dela3499 @GerberKawasaki Couldn’t agree more! We’re making this change soon. 

Main timeline should allow for an easy sideways swipe between top, latest, trending and topics that you follow. Twitter search nav already sorta does this after you search.
@GerberKawasaki In simple terms: 

As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop.
@GerberKawasaki Go back and read your old Securities Analysis 101 textbook
@pmarca Interesting
@TheRabbitHole84 @WallStreetSilv Tweets that are interesting or entertaining get traction. That’s why writers tend to do well on Twitter.
Yikes!
@GerberKawasaki Please tell us your great ideas, Ross …
@WallStreetSilv This has gone too far, to say the least! @Stanford, what is your explanation for this madness?
@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely
@KimDotcom Why has the mainstream media refused to report on this?
@Harris_X_ @Twitter Interesting. Suggest that maybe we might still have an itsy bitsy bot problem on Twitter …

Elvis is in the building
@WallStreetSilv No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.
@stillgray True
@lexfridman You must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?
As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it
@WholeMarsBlog The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive
Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.
Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won’t happen again.
@BillyM2k Paul’s account will be restored shortly
@TheQuartering @levie Policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that account’s *primary* purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule
@TheQuartering @levie Ok, that seems reasonable
@levie What do you think should be the policy?
@RobertKennedyJr @hodgetwins Precisely
@TrungTPhan @stillgray Casually sharing occasional links is fine, but no more relentless advertising of competitors for free, which is absurd in the extreme
@stillgray Exactly. Twitter should be easy to use, but no more relentless free advertising of competitors. No traditional publisher allows this and neither will Twitter.

@EricRWeinstein Temp suspension due to prior doxxing action by this account. Will be lifted shortly.
@neontaster Agreed, a high priority software update for Twitter is showing the reason for account suspension or deboosting. 

Rules should be equally &amp; consistently applied.
@KimDotcom Maybe it’s a coincidence 🤷‍♂️
@MartinKulldorff @DrJBhattacharya The tide is turning fast for the Faucists
@DavidSacks @mtaibbi Because they’re in on it
@teslaownersSV @Tesla A real concern!
@mayemusk @larryelder It’s fine
@ShefVaidya @Twitter @verified Will investigate
@DavidSacks They abandon even the pretense of noble principles in their zeal to keep their monopoly on information seen by the public
@KohlmanSweeney There will be multiple algorithms, including no algorithm (ie just tweets from those you follow in chronological order)
@larryelder And miss both times
True creation eventually becomes independent of its creator. Evolution takes the original product far from its origin, with an uncertain outcome.

@DineshDSouza Exactly
In addition, Twitter will make it easier to see tweets from just those you follow, as well as other tweet curations
@neontaster Wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media @jimmy_wales
@yashar If a group of accounts engages in “brigading”, the entire group of accounts will get a credibility score of zero, so their actions will be ineffective
@stillgray If an account engages in large-scale blocking, the value of a block signal from that account will trend to zero
@wrvb3 @michaelmalice A two day suspension of maybe 7 accounts for doxxing got an actual Wikipedia page!? Wikipedia is controlled by the MSM journalists. Can’t trust that site anymore.
To be clear, all user actions will factor into a NN model for a tweet and the account tweeting, including positive actions. 

As user accounts develop credibility, their actions will have greater weight, similar to how @CommunityNotes works.
@neontaster Haha
@teslaownersSV Correct
@jasondebolt Exactly
@ggreenwald True
@udiWertheimer @Jason Changing name or profile pic causes checkmark to disappear until account is reviewed by Twitter support team for impersonation

@Liz_Wheeler @mtaibbi Such a tangled web
@ClayTravis @Twitter Strange priorities …
@GerberKawasaki Securities Analysis 101

As the “risk-free” real rate of return from Treasury Bills approaches the much riskier rate of return from stocks, the value of stocks drop.

For example, if T-bills and stocks both had a 10% rate of return, everyone would just buy the former.
@lexfridman Exactly
Twitter will start incorporating mute &amp; block signals from Blue Verified (not Legacy Blue) as downvotes
The people have spoken.

Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now.
@catturd2 Indeed, there is no other reason
@Lukewearechange Umm … yeah
@RichardGarriott Ultima V for me
@littlemissjacob Such shameful behavior will not be tolerated going forward

@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna Rather than rigorously pursuing truth, you are virtue-signaling to show that you are “good” in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds
Great questions
@andy0___ @sama The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly
@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna Bari, this is a real question, not rhetorical. What is your opinion?
@GuyDealership Good prediction
@WholeMarsBlog Twitter is not the real world
@TomFitton @Twitter That’s what they are saying
@WallStreetSilv @micsolana Exactly. Same rules for all.
@CathieDWood @ARKInvest @GuyDealership Potentially, the biggest financial crisis ever
@dogeofficialceo Things are rather intense right now, but maybe closer to Christmas
@Timcast Correct
@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna What should the consequence of doxxing someone’s real-time, exact location be? Assume your child is at that location, as mine was.
@neontaster One day of Twitter suspension ≠ death
Twitter right now is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@jasondebolt My plane is actually not trackable without using non-public data
@Chad_Hurley No you
@JackPosobiec If they’re naughty, they get suspended
@sirmaejor @verified @TwitterSpaces We’re fixing a Legacy bug. Should be working tomorrow.
@alifarhat79 Twitter too, no doubt
@lexfridman That’s the goal!
@teslaownersSV @alx Next week
@alx So they’re saying  it’s really bad to suspend people from Twitter 🤔
@TweetBinder @jason_kint Woohoo 🔥🔥🔥
@CommunityNotes Community Notes expands!
@WholeMarsBlog Agreed
@AlecStapp @kimbal Absolutely
@AOC You first lol
@DavidSacks Seems fine to me
@conmomma Exactly
Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
Sorry, too many options. Will redo poll.
If anyone posted real-time locations &amp; addresses of NYT reporters, FBI would be investigating, there’d be hearings on Capitol Hill &amp; Biden would give speeches about end of democracy!
Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
@pmarca Words to live by
@alx @IFNY2775 @micsolana @JxckSweeney @ElonJet Yeah, we will add that feature. Current system isn’t clear.

A time delay on reporting location that doesn’t put people at serious risk of being killed is fine.
@IFNY2775 @micsolana Accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary 7 day suspension
@RAMansour @KeithOlbermann 7 day suspension for doxxing. Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul …
@micsolana They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service
I love Barbara Streisand lol
@IFNY2775 @micsolana Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not
@micsolana Same doxxing rules apply to “journalists” as to everyone else
@Caitlyn_Jenner Yup, recent events make that super clear!
@MuskUniversity So few understand this
@stillgray @MrAndyNgo Twitter obviously must be fair to all, so will aim to stop violent extremism being promoted by any group
@Teslaconomics Suggestions are welcome
@jhall Yeah
Anyone recognize this person or car? https://t.co/2U0Eyx7iwl
Last night, car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving &amp; climbed onto hood.

Legal action is being taken against Sweeney &amp; organizations who supported harm to my family.
Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.

Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn’t a safety problem, so is ok.
@jhall Real-time posting of someone else’s location violates doxxing policy, but delayed posting of locations are ok
@DirtyTesLa @Jason Up to 7 days for human review
@Jason Advertising revenue next year will be low industry-wide
@Balyx_ He would be welcome
@NorwayMFA @TwitterSupport @jonasgahrstore @AHuitfeldt Sorry!
@AvidHalaby Live &amp; learn …
@America1stLegal @DrJBhattacharya Extremely concerning …
@AndrewLawton Sounds like an attempt to muzzle the voice of the people of Canada
@conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Twitter may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased
@SirGrantFleming @conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Agreed, I thought the same!
@conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Looking into this
Highly recommended reading
@WholeMarsBlog @BarackObama Wise words from President Obama
@BillyM2k @WholeMarsBlog Oh man that would be an epic troll!!
@BillyM2k @Vvilelyn They just kept calling different viruses C19, because that got more funding than if not. 

That’s why I called it the “Virus of Theseus”: how many RNA changes are required before it’s *not* C19!?
@alex_avoigt Think long-term &amp; avoid leverage
@Apocalyp1Skynet @stillgray Literally https://t.co/F3m9QpqiaB
@EMTSLA None yet, but I did play some Cyberpunk and it works great. Syncs with your Steam profile, so you can pick up where you left off at home.
Even works with keyboard &amp; mouse
You can play Cyberpunk, Elden Ring and 1000s of other games in your *car* with an epic sound system!!
@Lukewearechange Yeah!
@realGeorgeHotz Accurate
@maxthegirl @stevanzetti but hates hypocrisy
@waitbutwhy @JesseAbraham Just when you think it can’t get crazier, it does
@BillyM2k @arstechnica Really?
@babylonmovie Basically, a Twitter documentary
@BillyM2k @unusual_whales @wallstmemes biggest crime of all
At risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates
@EMTSLA @HarryStebbings Unregretted user-minutes is the metric that matters most
@HarryStebbings Main reason is that the Starlink value proposition is “better Internet for less money” for most people in low population density areas, which is compelling no matter how the economy is doing
@elizableu @JeffBezos @washingtonpost Good question
@wintonARK True
@TheLeoTerrell @Twitter To be clear, I am generally pro-FBI, recognizing, of course, that no organization is perfect, including FBI
@wintonARK @NewsNancy9 @TomFitton Good thread
@TomFitton Yeah, they do
@cb_doge It’s gonna be great
@HarryStebbings Don’t want to jinx it, but SpaceX is positioned to grow strongly, no matter what macroeconomic conditions are like
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides
@ChefGruel haha
@RocketRick @Twitter Social media in general, especially Twitter, were eroding civilization. If civilization collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining, then nothing else matters. 

Human consciousness is gone.
@TheFP PayPal has become a Black Mirror episode
@BillyM2k Yeah
@dogeofficialceo @BillyM2k The best!
@BillyM2k Unfortunately, they will get bored of complaining to each other there &amp; return to complaining here
The ratio of digital to biological compute is growing exponentially
@JeanJuegaa @nytimes Same
@alx @hodgetwins @RVAwonk Bunny emojis are hate speech!!
@hodgetwins @RVAwonk This tutorial video explains the backstory https://t.co/sopNJjfyBl
@hodgetwins @RVAwonk Lmaooo
@micsolana Same 💕
@BillyM2k I think about this every time I take DayQuil or NyQuil
Follow 🐰
@PhilHollowayEsq @JohnBrennan Exactly
@GuntherEagleman @heydave7 First one was fine, but the booster knocked me flat for days. Way worse than when I got original C19 and was unvaccinated.
@Erdayastronaut @TwitterBlue Basic Blue will have half the number of ads. We will offer a higher tier with no ads next year.
@Lukewearechange @AndrewPollackFL Accurate
@BillyM2k Haha totally. High quality bots are fine!
@rupasubramanya @TheFP Exactly
@TRHLofficial @ggreenwald Indeed
@micsolana The wording is mine lol
@micsolana In a few months, we will remove all legacy blue checks. The way in which they were given out was corrupt and nonsensical.
@ggreenwald Seriously, they could just write one article and share it, since they all write exactly the same thing!
@ggreenwald True
@elizableu @andst7 @BrandonDrey @realDailyWire Terrible
@MomAngtrades Prior Twitter management &amp; board lied to make their user numbers seem artificially higher, so turned a blind eye to fake/spam accounts
Under pressure from hundreds of activist employees, Twitter deplatforms Trump, a sitting US President, even though they themselves acknowledge that he didn’t violate the rules:
@CrystalHope1979 @catturd2 Somehow, the nation of Sweden is fine
@JohnBrennan Your house is glass
The Branch Covidians are upset lol
@MaudMaron @StationCDRKelly Perfectly said
@teslaownersSV @Gfilche Number 1
@Lukewearechange Exactly
The woke mind virus is either defeated or nothing else matters
@Rainmaker1973 Big rockets are needed to make life multiplanetary!
@robbystarbuck @StationCDRKelly Many battles remain, but, yes, the tide is starting to turn on the mortal threat to civilization that is the woke mind virus
Truth resonates …
@catturd2 Easy to fool people, but it is almost impossible to convince people that they have been fooled
@StationCDRKelly I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.

As for Fauci, he lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome imo.
@KariLake Reasonable criticism of elections and judicial challenges are, of course, lawful. That seems to be the case here.

Clear incitement to violence will result in suspension and significant deception should result in a @CommunityNotes correction.
@Erdayastronaut How’s it looking?
@PPathole Great!
@DrJBhattacharya Thank you for your rigorous adherence to science
@nichegamer @BillyM2k @ScammerPayback We are making a lot of progress, but help is always appreciated
@BillyM2k They will try other methods, but we’re shutting them down as soon as they show up.

Twitter will also be moving to prosecute scammers anywhere on Earth.
@BillyM2k Mostly
Cool, the bots are so far unable to swarm to the top of my replies!
@Gfilche Must be done for the future of civilization, without which nothing matters
Calling all 🤖&amp; 🧌

Please attack me!
@thevivafrei @RitchieTorres Correct
@bradmcgash @saylor Agreed
@saylor That’s my guess: small number of humans with large bot/troll armies. We are shutting down IP addresses of known bad actors today. Should have been done long ago.
@stillgray Lmaooo
@GavinSBaker It’s gonna be 🔥🔥
@GavinSBaker Nature is healing
Hope you’re having a lovely Sunday! 😀
My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci
@murraymints82 Oh it is coming bigtime …
Now things get spicy 🌶️
Twitter is speeding up
Twitter was Wormtongue to the World
Saruman … your staff is broken.
https://t.co/JivXLgdejx
@GailAlfarATX The bots/trolls generate fake activity, so Twitter may seem a little less lively, but actually it’s just that the fakery is gone
@F1Womble No later than noon
The bots are in for a surprise tomorrow
@stillgray Traceroute woke_mind_virus
@Liz_Wheeler Good question
Deplatforming the President (cont.)
@Twitter And many other features to come!
Twitter is both a social media company and a crime scene
@elizableu Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services in his PhD thesis: https://t.co/1NiBohjhMQ
@elizableu This explains a lot
🇲🇦🇲🇦 Congrats Morocco!! 🇲🇦🇲🇦
@pepesgrandma @tedlieu Interesting, how so?
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @Twitter Coming soon …
@cancelmyfunera1 @SirineAti @coffeetabletsla @tedlieu Yeah
@coffeetabletsla @tedlieu Good po1nt
@tedlieu Hey stop gaslighting me!
@nichegamer It’s almost ready
@DomaineValescia At least! 🤣
@nichegamer We seriously need long-form tweets!
@sparklingruby Worth a read
@ZacksJerryRig Do I think Trump would have lost anyway? Yes. And, as a reminder, I supported Biden, Hilary and Obama.

Nonetheless, election interference by social media companies obviously undermines the public’s faith in democracy and is wrong.
@TomFitton @Twitter @realDonaldTrump Unequivocally true. The evidence is clear and voluminous.
@ggreenwald With rare exception, the FBI seems to want to do the right thing, but there is no question that Twitter operated as a Democratic Party activist machine
The Twitter Files, Part 3

Deplatforming the President
@laralogan Indeed. Shame on them!
@ellagirwin @jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley Correct
@realGeorgeHotz More than just a polycule in the Bahamas, that’s for sure!
@elizableu Exactly correct.
@CathieDWood Absolutely
@jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley @ellagirwin At the same time, Ned was spending millions of dollars on Warriors seats. Super messed up priorities.
@cb_doge @MomAngtrades Just a rough guess, but things probably start looking better in Q2 2024
@sourpatchlyds @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley Small world
@jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley No, it is not. 

When Ella Irwin, who now runs Trust &amp; Safety, joined Twitter earlier this year, almost no one was working on child safety.

She raised this with Ned &amp; Parag, but they rejected her staffing request.

I made it top priority immediately.

@ellagirwin
@liquidsunlabs Agreed
If the Fed raises rates again next week, the recession will be greatly amplified
@nichegamer @eltonofficial It’s true that most celebrities don’t write their own posts. More should. Way better to hear directly from them.
Something I always admired about American legislators, at least historically, was that they would sometimes vote against the party line
Good for @SenatorSinema! I hope more of our elected leaders act independently, aka in the interests of the people.
@micsolana Absolutely! The real CEO was the head of “Trust &amp; Safety”.
@Jason @aoscott Top Gun Maverick was great!

NYTimes has gone “full woke”.
@WholeMarsBlog In reality, Twitter is doing a much better job of combating disinformation. @CommunityNotes is a big part of that.
@eltonofficial I love your music. Hope you come back. Is there any misinformation in particular that you’re concerned about?
@Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!
@gdb New AI progress every week, it seems
@stillgray What is this “misinformation” that he refers to?
@saylor The general principle of improving signal to noise is incredibly important
@catturd2 Never leave a marine behind. Never.
@DriveTeslaca They are not long for this world
@TitterTakeover I slept on a couch in the Twitter library and I don’t ever wear slippers
These are obvious account deletions with no tweets &amp; no log in for years
Twitter will soon start freeing the name space of 1.5 billion accounts
@ThinkScrappy @RubinReport @SubstackInc @Twitter I’m open to the idea
@Jason @maddow @ezraklein Good way to frame it
@slashdot More AI advances
@BillyM2k @__SeriousGemini Tweets will show view count in a few weeks, just like videos do. Twitter is much more alive than people think.
Congrats on Game of Year! https://t.co/TMyHVbrZKW
@nichegamer @lexfridman @Jason @DavidSacks Greater Austin area blends to purple
@p_ferragu When there are macroeconomic risks, it is generally wise to avoid using margin loans on any company, as stocks may move in ways that are decoupled from their long-term potential
@unusual_whales Controversial decisions were often made without getting Jack’s approval and he was unaware of systemic bias. The inmates were running the asylum. 

Jack has a pure heart imo.
@Jason @BillyM2k @DavidSacks Extremists have already moved to such platforms as … I already forgot their names
Truth brings reconciliation
@lexfridman Exactly
@libsoftiktok You’re welcome. Twitter won’t be perfect in the future, but it will be *much* better.
@lexfridman @Jason @DavidSacks Yeah!
@alexstamos @DavidSacks @bariweiss You operate a propaganda platform
@DrJBhattacharya @bariweiss The Sun is coming
https://t.co/a7IPGLi4HH
@MkayUokay @DavidSacks @karol True, some accounts on the right were suspended even when Twitter internally acknowledged that no rules were broken
@DavidSacks As @bariweiss clearly describes, the rules were enforced against the right, but not against the left
@ErikGroset @AmandaMilius Really?
@AmandaMilius Twitter isn’t using Perkins Coie. No company should use them until they make amends for Sussman’s attempt to corrupt a Presidential election.
@BillyM2k @DavidSacks The far right and the far left will splinter off Twitter to irrelevant echo chambers
@BillyM2k @DavidSacks Agreed
@Jason @DavidSacks While subtle, if you look closely at this chart, you might notice a slight bias: https://t.co/QAC0GexiNz
@Jason @DavidSacks Most engineers don’t feel strongly about politics, but do want to work with other great engineers.

Silicon Valley has world’s best engineering talent, but is co-located with San Francisco, which is far left.

Thus, far left gained control of an incredibly powerful info weapon.
Twitter is working on a software update that will show your true account status, so you know clearly if you’ve been shadowbanned, the reason why and how to appeal
@libsoftiktok Looking into it
@MarinaMedvin DMs should be encrypted, so that it is impossible for anyone at Twitter to see the public’s DMs, just as is the case with Signal or iMessage
@bariweiss @libsoftiktok Former head of censorship at Twitter was perhaps not entirely unbiased … https://t.co/yynb9whc5S
@micsolana Exactly
The Twitter Files, Part Deux!! 🍿🍿
@iliketeslas I continue to oversee both Tesla &amp; SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me
@WholeMarsBlog Macro conditions are difficult: energy in Europe, real estate in China &amp; crazy Fed rates in USA
@SawyerMerritt This capability will save many lives
@RepAdamSchiff @RepMarkTakano False, hate speech impressions are actually down by 1/3 for Twitter now vs prior to acquisition @CommunityNotes
@SawyerMerritt But the really mind-blowing thing is that this means your phone will work anywhere on Earth, unless blocked by local government!
@SawyerMerritt Important to note that this is *total* bandwidth within a cell, so would be divided among all phones. 

Starlink will be great for text messages, voice calls &amp; low res pics. If only a dozen phones are active, which is true in remote regions, then video will work.
@SawyerMerritt Tesla Team has done incredibly well, despite extremely difficult times. Could not be more proud of them.

@EricRWeinstein @bariweiss @mtaibbi Only discovered this on Sunday
@TedrickG @sfdbi @KQEDnews So city of SF attacks companies providing beds for tired employees instead of making sure kids are safe from fentanyl. Where are your priorities @LondonBreed!?

https://t.co/M7QJWP7u0N
@samgabnz @mtaibbi Yes. His explanation was …unconvincing.
@mtaibbi In light of concerns about Baker’s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today
@stillgray Most of Earth: “The MSM is biased.”
Wikipedia: “Cite MSM source to confirm this claim.” 🤣🤣

Wikipedia has a non-trivial left-wing bias.

@jimmy_wales, what are your thoughts?
@karpathy The ratio of total digital to total biological compute is the key metric to watch – it is rising incredibly fast
@WholeMarsBlog Bold
So many interesting posts on Twitter these days!
@MarioNawfal Fixed
@RubinReport The ads are also way too big. We’ll fix it this week.
@MuskUniversity Wait, is this true!?
@MuskUniversity In the past, victory would mean that your enemies are no longer around. These days, they’re not only alive &amp; well, but have lots of time on their hands to edit Wikipedia!
Starship takes beings of Earth to Mars https://t.co/6qaIc3p4yA
@sama What’s the average cost per chat?
@WholeMarsBlog Electric cargo ships are straightforward, as are short to medium range electric aircraft. Long-range aircraft (beyond ~1500 mile) will take a few more years.
@BillyM2k Team was a bit too intense with spam/bot suspensions. Moving to chill mode.
@WholeMarsBlog About a week or so
@COLDEX_STC @SpaceX @NSF @blueicehiggins @icy_pete @US_IceDrilling @OSUCEOAS @Princeton @GeosciencesPU @OregonState @UMNews Wild that we can see what was frozen 2.7 million years ago!

@Helloimmorgan @thebias_news What’s wrong?
@WholeMarsBlog Lmaooo
@BillyM2k Looking into it
@StonksReddit @thebias_news Yeah (sigh)
@FoxNews The Constitution is greater than any President. End of story.
@thebias_news I take that as a compliment!
@WholeMarsBlog You do, that’s the fundamental difference
The intelligence of this hive-mind will improve significantly as signal/noise, effective cross-linking of tweets &amp; speed of tweets all improve
@ClayTravis @Twitter @nytimes More importantly, they said nothing about ChatGPT! Totally 😴 at the 🚃.
Anything anyone says will be used against me in a court of law
@waitbutwhy Not surprising, as I just learned that OpenAI had access to Twitter database for training. I put that on pause for now. 

Need to understand more about governance structure &amp; revenue plans going forward.

OpenAI was started as open-source &amp; non-profit. Neither are still true.
@WholeMarsBlog &gt;95% of people still have no idea this is here
@DavidSacks @biz @mtaibbi @bariweiss Let’s find out 😉
@BillyM2k Whoa
@POTUS Worth mentioning that Tesla has open-sourced its charge connector and is enabling other EVs to use Tesla Superchargers
@WholeMarsBlog He has swagger
@POTUS Or you can just buy a Tesla
@POTUS I kinda like this post tbh
@ajtourville Remember that 2022 flicking tiger’s nuts meme I posted? Well …
The more Twitter improves its signal to noise ratio, the less relevant conventional news becomes
Trees of thought https://t.co/wxeirrmG9E
Great work by Twitter Spaces team!
Looks like we will need another day or so
@wintonARK Wow. Meanwhile, on Twitter …
Pretty wild that you can engage in back-and-forth dialogue with over 100k people live on Twitter Spaces!
@thevivafrei And, in doing so, destroy their credibility
I am not expressing an opinion, but did promise to conduct this poll.

Should Assange and Snowden be pardoned?
Just a note to thank advertisers for returning to Twitter
@ggreenwald @yoyoel True
@karpathy Let’s throw a party and invite the whole galaxy!
@Devin_Simonson Agreed. Let’s just give him an adult timeout in the big house &amp; move on.
SBF was bad at League. Nuff said.
@Jason @theallinpod Great podcast!
@lhfang Interesting
@TEDchris @nytimes That’s because ChatGPT is not a far left cause. The New York Times should rename itself The Social Justice Times.
@ggreenwald @mtaibbi @CommunityNotes is super important for getting closer to truth
@KevinThobias @thevivafrei Exactly
@sama ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.
@thevivafrei Good questions
@ggreenwald @mtaibbi True
@andst7 Thank you for helping with this important problem
@neontaster ChatGPT is so much better at bullshit than they are!
@thevivafrei True lol
@ClayTravis @Twitter @nytimes That is because The New York Times has become, for all intents and purposes, an unregistered lobbying firm for far left politicians
@WillManidis That’s just the publicly disclosed number. His actual support of Dem elections is probably over $1B. The money went somewhere, so where did it go?
@OzraeliAvi I’ve seen a lot of concerning tweets about the recent Brazil election. If those tweets are accurate, it’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates.
Twitter servers are running at Warp 9!! https://t.co/vtZZeKupC7
@Carnage4Life The safety of any AI system can be measured by its MtH (meantime to Hitler). Microsoft’s Tay chatbot of several years ago got there in ~24 hours.
@Kristennetten @pmarca Haha pretty close. Electrical closet.
@pmarca Funny thing is that there was actually a little fire at Twitter HQ earlier this week! Whole building was evacuated.
@pmarca 🥰🥰

I recently learned that OpenAI receives a lot of its data from Twitter
@cmsintern Truth
@Timcast Correct
@farzyness Some things are priceless …
@micsolana Well-said
@BillyM2k Exactly
Tune in for Episode 2 of The Twitter Files tomorrow!
@lexfridman Transparency is the key to trust
@TheQuartering Q&amp;A tomorrow
@hodgetwins @micsolana Twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a 1st amendment violation, but acting under orders from the government to suppress free speech, with no judicial review, is
@micsolana If this isn’t a violation of the Constitution’s First Amendment, what is?
@micsolana “Handled” 🔥🔥🔥
@mtaibbi Ro Khanna is great
@EmmanuelMacron It was an honor to see you again. Looking forward to exciting plans in France!
Here we go!! 🍿🍿
We’re double-checking some facts, so probably start live tweeting in about 40 mins
@stillgray Oh you mean the same MSM that all colluded to suppress the story? That MSM?
This will be awesome 🍿
What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!
@Jason Agreed
@johnkrausphotos Both false positives and negatives matter
Please screenshot examples that Twitter needs to fix
Not counting those behind the “see more replies” aka probable spam button
Major Twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spam/scam accounts.

Taking just past 24 hours, does it seem like there are far fewer?
Twitter is now serving almost 90 billion tweet impressions per day!

Just how incredibly alive the system actually is will become obvious as we show view count on all tweets.
@BillyM2k Agreed
There are about 500M tweets per day &amp; billions of impressions, so hate speech impressions are &lt;0.1% of what’s seen on Twitter!
@nytimes Utterly false
@Ravii_kc We will publish stats on Love Speech too, as it is vastly higher than Hate Speech!
Hate speech impressions (# of times tweet was viewed) continue to decline, despite significant user growth!

@TwitterSafety will publish data weekly.

Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom of reach. Negativity should &amp; will get less reach than positivity. https://t.co/36zl29rCSM
@Kristennetten Please report accounts doing so. Repeated harassment falls into the spam category, so will result in a temp suspension.
@kylenabecker That resulted in a major spike. Twitter will be publishing actual “hate speech” (same list company has always used) impressions later today &amp; every week going forward.
@BillyM2k The (currently) quiet majority should tweet more!
You know Twitter is being fair when extremists on far right and far left are simultaneously upset!

Twitter aims to serve center 80% of people, who wish to learn, laugh &amp; engage in reasoned debate. ❤️
@stillgray Right on schedule 🤣🤣
@shortword @M3Marcel @WholeMarsBlog Current efficiency is 1.7kWh/mile, but there is a clear path to 1.6, possibly 1.5
@andst7 I have Sam Gamgee’s words on my bedside table
@KimDotcom @kanyewest Just clarifying that his account is being suspended for incitement to violence, not an unflattering pic of me being hosed by Ari. 

Frankly, I found those pics to be helpful motivation to lose weight!
@TheeAleexJ @kanyewest I tried my best. Despite that, he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.
@kanyewest This is not
@kanyewest That is fine
@alex_avoigt This is silly. Only two numbers are needed to calculate range: battery energy density and average vehicle energy consumed per unit distance.
@wintonARK Accurate
@woodhaus2 Check out the Tesla exhibit at 
@Petersen_Museum in LA!

@kanyewest Jesus taught love, kindness and forgiveness. 

I used to think that turning the other cheek was weak &amp; foolish, but I was the fool for not appreciating its profound wisdom.
🇯🇵🇯🇵 Congratulations Japan! 🇯🇵🇯🇵
https://t.co/WfqWIJMNGI
@JamieHutchens4 How many views do your tweets get?
@yvanleterrible2 We aren’t doing well at surfacing tweets from less prominent handles, as it’s almost impossible to distinguish between authentic humans vs bots/trolls. 

This is why $8/month with phone and optional ID verification, as well as organizational affiliation, is so important.
AI is getting really good
@dcherring @araghougassian @Spooks Exactly. That’s why I’m encouraging people to interact with Twitter more!
@jordanbpeterson Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.

There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!
@araghougassian @Spooks View count will show how many people actually see tweets, just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!
@araghougassian @Spooks The problem is that likes are public, subjecting people to criticism, and “like” is often the wrong description, as you often just think something is interesting or notable, but not likable. 

We need to add these critical distinctions.
@Spooks Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets, just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem.
@Spooks Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)? 

Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%.
I meet so many people who read twitter every day, but almost never tweet.

If I may beg your indulgence, please add your voice to the public dialogue!
@westcoastbill Agreed
@verdouglasgomes @nandorappa40 Looking into it
@WholeMarsBlog Digging into this now
Lot of people stuck in a damn-that’s-crazy ChatGPT loop 🔁
@zswitten There still isn’t a good strawberry picking robot, but researchers are working on it.

As they apply AI to maximizing how many strawberries get picked, it might do whatever it takes to get more &amp; more planted, until eventually there are strawberry fields forever …
As a reminder, tap the stars icon on upper right of screen to switch between latest people you follow and recommended tweets
@cocainebear Always wondered about that bear …
Twitter is purging a lot of spam/scam accounts right now, so you may see your follower count drop
@EvaFoxU Exactly
@ashleevance We are now confident that the Neuralink device is ready for humans, so timing is a function of working through the FDA approval process
Exciting Neuralink update in 30 mins!
@SawyerMerritt Congratulations @jimfarley98 @Ford!
Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.
@jhall Cancel culture needs to be canceled!!
@teslaownersSV Wow, thank you for the kind words @reedhastings
@HistoryInPics Feels like an eternity ago
Thanks @tim_cook for taking me around Apple’s beautiful HQ https://t.co/xjo4g306gR
@EvaFoxU @Reuters Exactly. The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. 

Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed.
Update from @Neuralink at 6pm PT
@NorthmanTrader @vincent13031925 Exactly
@vincent13031925 Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.
@teslaownersSV Much more, but I am simply stating the obvious
@teslaownersSV We’re implementing anti-bot bots. You should see some improvement by tomorrow.
Microservices …
 https://t.co/w6K0t1SRRs
Twitter core services latency reduced by ~400ms. Should feel noticeably faster.
@stevenmarkryan @nichegamer Sam lost me when he said that any lies at all would justify Trump losing. 

I mean … Sam literally wrote a book about why lying is evil!

https://t.co/KwLOyqHjpu https://t.co/VTbNWWeGDj
@farzyness Accurate prediction
A little more progress to Mars
@jasondebolt Several other major Democrat politicians attacked me too, all around the same time. It was coordinated.

Outside of party leadership and independents like Manchin, they are essentially actors on the political stage, not directors or script writers.
@nichegamer Sam used to be so rational! There is such a thing as too much meditation …
@ICannot_Enough Correct
@TrungTPhan Don’t love the name, but the drink itself is amazing &amp; brings me joy 😀
@DavidSacks This is a serious problem
@mtracey This makes sense
The people have spoken …
If Community Notes can correct me, then obviously they can correct anyone. This is a good example. They were right to add the label.
@TheQuartering I think I have been very specific
@DavidSacks It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
@cb_doge @stillgray @ezralevant @latimes That one was real too
@stillgray @ezralevant @latimes The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!

Satire is reveals a deeper truth.
@Liz_Wheeler This will forever be our top priority
This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.
@SwipeWright This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.
@BillyM2k Exactly
@saylor @lexfridman Absolutely, especially if done in collusion with the government
The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened …
@RubinReport Why are so many in the media against free speech? This is messed up.
@Jason A revolution against online censorship in America
@stillgray Support is greatly appreciated!
@TheRabbitHole84 Wow, they don’t sound biased at all!
Did you know Apple puts a secret 30%  tax on everything you buy through their App Store?
Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why
@LBRYcom Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers
@rupasubramanya @bariweiss Here works
Accurate
@techAU Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla?
Who else has Apple censored?
@LBRYcom What terms?
What’s going on here @tim_cook?
Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?
@CNNPR Lmaoooo
Greetings, I’m Musket, Elon Musket
@TVGuyGrayson Hearting things that you just want to highlight is questionable
@paulg @kimbal True
@tobi @nandoodles @Shopify Good for you!
There is no excuse for my lack of coasters
@B_Jones2009 Yah, it’s mostly basic
My bedside table https://t.co/sIdRYJcLTK
The amount of pro psy ops on Twitter is ridiculous! At least with new Verified they will pay $8 for the privilege haha.
@Renew_Democracy @Kasparov63 @AVindman Your anti-dictator stance is as controversial as it is brave. From whence cometh your 💰?
@ShiLLin_ViLLian I’m optimistic that we will make some progress
@ggreenwald Exactly
@ggreenwald That American media would argue *against* free speech in America – within the bounds of the law – is an utter travesty.

Shame on them! Shame, shame, shame.
@02100_eth That might be cool to show publicly, now that you mention it
@BillyM2k You probably weren’t blocking 4000 accounts per second
@VassiliosBitsas Friends have asked me if there’s a way to recover their old vine videos! Will look into it.
@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k System obviously needs immediate alerts for any sudden spike in database writes of any kind
@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k That’s literally how I found out!
@johnkrausphotos It’s on the todo list
Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.
@BillyM2k @Msannthrope57 This whole thread is making your point for you
@BillyM2k Absolutely!
@BillyM2k Working on it
And I am paying $8 btw :)
Just a note to encourage people of different political or other views to engage in civil debate on Twitter. 

Worst case, the other side has a slightly better understanding of your views.
@growing_daniel Remote is fine, but the bar for excellence &amp; trust is higher to overcome communication difficulties
@Jason Good old random partial reinforcement gets ya every time!
@neontaster Vindman is both puppet &amp; puppeteer. Question is who pulls his strings … ?
@Trainwreckstv @stillgray Fortunately, I work late. Would you like fries with that?
@neontaster Note, spamming, whether done by a set of humans or bots is against ToS
@stillgray @neontaster Like digital ventriloquist dolls 🤣
@SamTwits Was also due to me that we got trademark to use Tesla Motors as initial name &amp; later obtained https://t.co/46TXqRJBrz URL
@satanskitty6969 @GrahamAllen_1 @StephenKing He is invited!
@neontaster Or maybe just … bots 🤷‍♂️
@neontaster They’re bots in human form
@SamTwits ArtCenter College of Design gave me an honorary degree for my work on the original Tesla Roadster
@SamTwits More importantly, I was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster. Eberhard was wealthy and could have risked his money, but was unwilling to do so.
@stillgray For many celebrities, it’s actually their manager or “team” writing their tweets. Might be the case here.
@stillgray Seems like NPC to PC ratio is super high!
@stillgray Good question
@BillyM2k They won’t give up controlling the narrative easily …
@rawsalerts Good idea
@hodgetwins True
@PPathole @StephenKing Correct
@jordanbpeterson I think I see a path to Twitter exceeding a billion monthly users in 12 to 18 months
@Teslaconomics He can drive it himself if he wants!

@GrahamAllen_1 @StephenKing Stephen King is one of most creative people on Earth. While I may not agree with everything he says, I do actually want to hear it.
@Gfilche @realGeorgeHotz @WholeMarsBlog World-class software aces are joining Twitter
Follow World Cup on Twitter for best real-time coverage! https://t.co/9IfFSHbjl3
@StephenKing The goal is a trusted digital town square, where a wide range of views are tolerated, provided people don’t break the law or spam. For example, any incitement to violence will result in account suspension.
@CollinRugg Better
@StephenKing Suggestions are welcome Mr. 👑
@SciGuySpace Tonnage to orbit is the better metric
@alex_avoigt Correct. Good thread.
@AGHamilton29 @NateSilver538 This alleged expert is saying things that are flat-out false. I have now said several times of Twitter that incitement to violence, obviously including threats of physical harm, will result in account suspension.
@gunsnrosesgirl3 Will look into it
@Rainmaker1973 I wonder what Earth will be like 88 million years from now
@WholeMarsBlog Most people still have no idea. FSD is the most important software release of any kind in a very long time.
@getpaidwrite He is infected with a mental version of this physical virus https://t.co/D639ASTAA0
@getpaidwrite That the mind virus is pushing humanity towards extinction is not hyperbole https://t.co/1BaiMRSvAy
Simpson’s predicts I buy Twitter S26E12 https://t.co/yVmWGwrYY6
@teslaownersSV @stillgray It’s insane! I’m just fighting for free speech in America.
@ProudElephantUS @TimRunsHisMouth But Twitter as a platform must be fair to all
@TimRunsHisMouth But freedom of speech is the bedrock of a strong democracy and must take precedence.

My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far.
@TimRunsHisMouth As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump
@mtaibbi Interesting development
@TimRunsHisMouth I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account, despite no violation of the law or terms of service.

Deplatforming a sitting President undermined public trust in Twitter for half of America.
@Liz_Wheeler I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone
@stillgray Concerning
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Calling for violence will result in suspension
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Absolutely
@Esqueer_ Incitement to violence will result in account suspension. 

Currently suspended accounts will be enabled slowly next week after manual review to determine whether they have potentially broken the law or engaged in spam.

Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views.
@stillgray Accurate
@MattWallace888 @saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich If it actually becomes a problem, we will take those and other steps
@saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich Deliberate impersonation/deception will result in account suspension. 

Organizational affiliation, bio and follower count distinguish between people who genuinely have the exact same name.

We shall see how it goes.
@Marco_Cim @KimDotcom The clawback may be their biggest fear
@dvorahfr @getpaidwrite Exactly
@getpaidwrite I am neither conventionally right nor left, but I agree with your point. 

The woke mind virus has thoroughly penetrated entertainment and is pushing civilization towards suicide.

There needs to be a counter-narrative.
@realGeorgeHotz We can aspire to turn it to the betterment of all
What do you think of the culture war?
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul That is a disturbing story and very concerning that Twitter took no action, despite clear violation of ToS. Report in this thread for now.
@Cryptoking @RBReich All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes “notable” is otherwise too subjective.

Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.

Longer explanation next week.
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
@Cryptoking @RBReich Sorry for the delay, we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week. 

Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates. 

Painful, but necessary.
@RBReich Interesting … now pay $8
@stillgray @axios Much Ado About Nothing
@AP But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
@AP AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
@ThePrashanthCB @viniciuscfp82 Mars plans are still moving forward
@viniciuscfp82 How can it be both illegal and “by the court”? Twitter must abide by the laws of each country or get shut down.
Thanksgiving cuisine is such a delightful symphony of flavor!
@jordanbpeterson This is simply based on the same list of terms that Twitter has used for some time, so ceteris paribus
@WSJmarkets WSJ giving foot massages to a criminal
@wallstreetpro @kevinolearytv Amazing 🤩
@SGTValadez @BillyM2k Jack has a pure heart
@agazdecki Some have simply been abandoned, but vast numbers of handles were consumed by bots/trolls. Aiming to start freeing those up next month.
The people have spoken.

Amnesty begins next week.

Vox Populi, Vox Dei.
You might notice small, sometimes major, improvements in speed of Twitter. Will be especially significant in countries far away from USA.
Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta is now available to anyone in North America who requests it from the car screen, assuming you have bought this option. 

Congrats to Tesla Autopilot/AI team on achieving a major milestone!
@TomFitton That’s the general idea
@ramzpaul Removing child exploitation is priority #1. Please reply in comments if you see anything that Twitter needs to address.
@joevezz Oh we have quite the adventure ahead!
Reducing the max allowed tweets/day to a number below what a speed typist on meth could do was helpful
I have half a mind to wag my finger at the 1500 accounts that caused the spike, but I shall forebear 🙄
@alx @nypost This is necessary to restore public trust
@JohnathonWillow Yeah, these are umm … bad words. I read through the list last week &amp; have to say I learned a few things 😳!!
@TheKameroon Great point! ♥️♥️♥️
@ahmedsalims Fun level on Twitter has definitely increased! I’m having a great time tbh.
Hate speech impressions down by 1/3 from pre-spike levels. Congrats to Twitter team! https://t.co/5BWaQoIlip
@montreal_girl @bradmcgash @teddyschleifer @CommunityNotes Working on it
@catturd2 @Rainmaker1973 They need to exist to stop scams, spam, NSFW &amp; illegal stuff from going viral, but they should obviously not be used for political purposes
@PatrickWStanley @BillyM2k It is objectively the case that “conservative” political candidates were more negatively affected than “progressive” candidates.

Anyone using Twitter knows this. Question is simply one of magnitude.
@engineers_feed Neil A, which is alien spelled backwards, was first person on the moon, and the year was 69 …
@stillgray Agreed, that is not ok
@teddyschleifer If SBF was as good at running a crypto exchange as he was at bribing media, FTX would still be solvent!
Have a great Thanksgiving! 🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸
@TrungTPhan Is this really still happening @nytimes?
@slashdot @dealbook This is one the biggest failures in US journalistic integrity of the 21st century
@ParikPatelCFA Lol, but actually true
@BillyM2k The more I learn, the worse it gets. The world should know the truth of what has been happening at Twitter.

Transparency will earn the trust of the people.
@RyanZohoury @WholeMarsBlog @semaforben Good point. Conflicts of interest should be made readily apparent to the reader.
@sourpatchlyds @semaforben Just wow …
@WholeMarsBlog @semaforben They should get a “SBF-Affiliated Media” label 🤣
@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben That’s why he won’t answer
@semaforben To be direct, the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill.
@semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company, but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did, when in fact he owns 0%. 

For the last time, how much of you does SBF own? Stop dodging the question.
@vanschneider To be fair, there are many people at Twitter working late into the night, for whom I have great respect
Awesome new Twitter merch! https://t.co/zqdL9xGRuR
@EricRWeinstein It has been really bad. Far left San Francisco/Berkeley views have been propagated to the world via Twitter. 

I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone watching closely.

Twitter is moving rapidly to establish an even playing field. No more thumb on the scale!
@jonesville @BusinessInsider It’s not a real publication
@DavidSacks 🤣🤣 with maybe a little editorial help from SBF’s employees @semafor
@DogePotamus @dogehodl2021 @StephenKing This is awesome
@EricNewcomer @karaswisher No grey area. Flat wrong.
@EricNewcomer @karaswisher On the other @semafor *did* take the SBF money and @semaforben won’t disclose how much SBF owns of them
@EricNewcomer @karaswisher I did not take the money. SBF/FTX do not own shares in Twitter.
World Cup traffic hit almost 20,000 tweets per second today! Great work by Twitter team managing record usage.
@StephenKing Headline: “Stephen King Tweet Causes My Pillow Sales to Skyrocket!” Lmaooo
@DennisCricket_ Haha sorry code release towards end of next week should allow this again
@David_Ingram @semaforben @semafor No. He may have owned shares in Twitter as a public company, but he certainly does not own shares in Twitter as a private company.
@karaswisher There was a time when you cared about the truth. That is long gone.
@semaforben @semafor As I said, neither I nor Twitter have taken any investment from SBF/FTX. Your article is a lie. 

Now, I’m asking again, how much of you does SBF own?
@wintonARK It was getting to the point where the minimum impulse bit for a Silicon Valley startup was a billion dollar market cap!
Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?
@engineers_feed @Twitter So much to fix at Twitter (sigh)
@StatistaCharts There are lies, there are damn lies, and then there is Statista
@BillyM2k Some things more so than others (sigh)
@MrAndyNgo True
@ZacksJerryRig @CommunityNotes What do your jeans tell you? https://t.co/a2o6XSLm7t
@ZacksJerryRig According to Obama’s DoJ, the Ferguson shooting was unequivocally self-defense, so the Ferguson protests were – if you believe Obama’s DoJ – based on a false premise.

That’s not to say that other injustices don’t occur, but this does not appear to be one of them. @CommunityNotes
@ZacksJerryRig Full text:
https://t.co/PervJOJQbq
@ZacksJerryRig What conspiracy theory? This what Obama’s DoJ published: https://t.co/O4DYAy63dD
@Rainmaker1973 @gunsnrosesgirl3 Looking into it
@Rainmaker1973 There was an error last week where the system incorrectly suspended &amp; deboosted your account. I’m told that those are now cleared.
@JohnPhillips Truth over time builds trust. Nothing else.
@elizableu I would like to know too
@semaforben @semafor What percentage of you does he own?
@hiromichimizuno Congratulations
More and more over time, as we hew closer to the truth, Twitter will earn the trust of the people
I hope you get that which truly makes you happy
@MattWallace888 @semafor Inmates are running the asylum at WaPo while Jeff parties in his hot tub
@realchasegeiser 🤣🤣 worth it
@semafor What’s going on here @semaforben?
@semafor Semafor is owned by SBF. This is a massive conflict of interest in your reporting. Journalistic integrity is 🗑️. https://t.co/1AB6KReJUj
What is best in life?
@stillgray Troublesome
@realGeorgeHotz Welcome to Twitter!
@BusinessInsider False. Also, Business is still not a real publication. Just give up.
@StephenKing What *is* the best pillow?
@StephenKing Is My Pillow actually a great pillow? Now I’m curious.
@StephenKing Oh hi lol
@EMTSLA @WholeMarsBlog Agreed
Maybe we’ve gone to heaven/hell &amp; don’t know it 🤔
Found in closet at Twitter HQ fr 🤣🤣 https://t.co/3xSI3KvvHk
@CEOAdam Twitter is where the opinion leaders are
@catturd2 @PatrickW @kylenabecker @Twitter I am cautiously optimistic that things will work out well
@kimbal @TheEconomist Nice
Wasn’t Twitter supposed to die by now or something … ?
@PatrickW @kylenabecker @Twitter A large coalition of political/social activist groups agreed not to try to kill Twitter by starving us of advertising revenue if I agreed to this condition.

They broke the deal.
@DineshDSouza Correct
@kylenabecker @Twitter Not even Associated Press with their completely fictional report on Russian missiles hitting Poland that carried severe consequences for escalating the war
@wizecrax @stillgray @kylenabecker @Twitter This is messed up
@kylenabecker @Twitter As is obvious to all but the media, there is not one permanent ban on even the most far left account spouting utter lies
@kylenabecker @Twitter True
@waitbutwhy It is shocking how many journalists viscously attack free speech, but somehow think they’re the good guys!
@BillyM2k the olden daze
@jakeshieldsajj Indeed
@R6BTuxYEfbGYIoB What do you mean?
Wait, if I Tweet does that count as work?
@SirineAti @Anc_Aesthetics Twitter
@PPathole @Anc_Aesthetics Yeah, about 6 months ago
@Syndicate I see a path
@TeslaGong @CSMFHT It’s coming
@teslaownersSV @CSMFHT Looking into it
@Anc_Aesthetics Pretty sure that was in Elden Ring
@unusual_whales Perhaps not unreasonable to know if anything was accomplished 🫶
This will improve a lot as Twitter becomes fast to use outside of North America, Western Europe &amp; Japan
@sama Plot twist!
@dogeofficialceo @MrBeast Written content too
@MrBeast Let’s see what happens when Twitter offers good video with higher compensation for creators …
The Tactics of Mistake
Twitter added 1.6M daily active users this past week, another all-time high https://t.co/Si3cRYnvyD
Holding off relaunch of Blue Verified until there is high confidence of stopping impersonation. 

Will probably use different color check for organizations than individuals.
@egoraptor lmao
@PPathole Dune. Amazing to think it was written in 1965!

Starlink now works for high latitudes
Tesla Megapacks are highly effective in addressing electricity demand spikes that cause power outages
@JamesSpiro @Israel @taylorswift13 I have! It was great.
@cb_doge @DanSum519 @stillgray Not many tbh
@Israel @taylorswift13 Your tweets are good! More countries should tweet like this. No fun being all stuffy.
Experience: what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted - Igor
@DanSum519 @stillgray Oh they’ll be back on Twitter, if they even actually left. This platform is like pharmaceutical-grade crack to them.

@lexfridman Good times :)
@LanceUlanoff @Rainmaker1973 Then let us work to make the future better
@rationalwalk @BillFOXLA @FoxNews We should actively recruit the best &amp; brightest to part of the United States! 

That is what every championship sports team does.

World Cup starts soon! Follow on Twitter for best coverage by far.
@TomFitton Sure as night follows day …
@JGreenblattADL @ADL Hey stop defaming me!

@EMTSLA @teslaownersSV @RaheemKassam @nypost Good idea

@TheBabylonBee 🤣 but actually
134M people have seen this poll
@TrungTPhan Red Bull does work tbh
@BillyM2k @lexfridman Definitely need to improve Twitter’s dopamine/cortisol ratio!
@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy I agree
The most entertaining outcome is the most likely – my variant on Occam’s Razor
@alexxubyte Twitter search will add feedback loops to improve result rank based on which result you click on &amp; whether you immediately click back (implies wrong result)
@alexxubyte Notes from last night:
- Maybe deprecate TLS this week, as only needed if Android app &gt;1 year old.
- Home mixer computes Home  ~10X faster than Timeline.
- Ad mixer can greatly improve relevance at cost of lower total ad views. More interesting the ad, more time you look at it.
@ErrolWebber Most accurate would be to require access to phone GPS for location-specific polls
Fascinating to watch Twitter Trump poll!
@Nomad_1x Bot &amp; troll armies might be running out of steam soon. Some interesting lessons to clean up future polls.
@DavidSacks Good question
@WholeMarsBlog Most amount of people I’ve ever seen in the building by far

Trump poll getting ~1M votes/hour!
@micsolana Can’t tell if this is parody or real
@jack @Lucididy @jordanbpeterson Verification through the payment system plus phones, but allowing pseudonyms is the least bad solution I can think of
@saylor When polls are about a significant question, even those who don’t follow me tend to hear about it. That said, I agree with the idea of an all-user poll. Should also be an all-user by country poll.
@lexfridman Agreed
Reinstate former President Trump
@thevivafrei @paraga @jack Too bad
@slashdot App store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly. 

It is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.
@Tesmanian_com Kind of him to say. I look forward to meeting.
First World Cup match on Sunday! Watch on Twitter for best coverage &amp; real-time commentary.
@BillyM2k Exactly
@Benioff Thanks Marc ❤️
Note, this applies just to the individual tweet, not the whole account
@TheBabylonBee If only there had been a way … 🤣🤣
Kathie Griffin, Jorden Peterson &amp; Babylon Bee have been reinstated.

Trump decision has not yet been made.
New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.

Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. 

You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet.
Freedom Fridays …
@BillyM2k Jazz hands 🤗
What should Twitter do next?
@micsolana You don’t say …
@SamTwits Of course not ❤️
@MikeDulaimi I stand corrected!
@AOC You’re welcome
@WholeMarsBlog Record numbers of users are logging in to see if Twitter is dead, ironically making it more alive than ever!
@piersmorgan Seriously
Let that sink in …
And … we just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol
@stoolpresidente The best people are staying, so I’m not super worried
@bgurley @MichaelGuimarin Don’t wanna jinx it, but there’s a chance we can keep Twitter alive … https://t.co/mk3aCq0dEB
@anothercohen Thanks for helping out. You’re a lifesaver!
@MichaelGuimarin Thanks!
How do you make a small fortune in social media?

Start out with a large one.
@EvaFoxU The media constantly writing about Twitter is driving usage to all-time highs, so it’s fine by me!
@MinimalDuck @Tesla Cybertruck is something special that comes along once in a long while
@heydave7 Current class-action law is actually a massive tax on the American people and desperately needs reform. It is one of the reasons medication is so expensive in the USA.

Somehow, other countries do just fine without class-action law.
@heydave7 The actual attackers in class-action lawsuits are the law firms. They just find someone in the class to be their puppet.
@chazman We’re working on something that should rank replies automatically
Twitter is like open-sourcing the news
@sama Probably
SBF is ineffective altruism, but they thought he was saying he was in effective altruism. Easy misunderstanding.
@growing_daniel @jeremiahscholl I don’t wanna brag but … it’s true
@minliangtan Definitely
Not to mention the sickkk memes lol
Coverage of FTX meltdown is incomparably faster *and* better quality on Twitter than old-school media
@BillyM2k @adamscochran @accretionist Ability to do long tweets coming soon
@AutismCapital It’s not his fault, society is to blame. Arrest society!
@DavidSacks I believe in vice-signaling
@laurenweinstein @stocktalkweekly Correct. I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.
@jack Magic 🎱 knows all
@amitkgupta84 @Jason Literally working on that tonight
@paulg People have no idea how fast Twitter will evolve
@realGeorgeHotz @boing Sure, let’s talk.
@jimmyfallon Wait a second, how do we know you’re not an alien body snatcher pretending to be Jimmy!? 

Say something that only the real Jimmy would say …
@rising_serpent Why is that?
@jimmyfallon Sounds like a job for @CommunityNotes!
@bowx_ To heir is human, to forgive, divine (something like that)
@jimmyfallon Fix what?
@Mrwhosetheboss Maybe
@NASA @NASAArtemis @NASA_SLS @NASA_Orion Congratulations!!
@JuliusSinghania @wongmjane X will be the everything app
@yukaichou I’m the taint haha
@nichegamer @teslaownersSV @chicago_glenn @stillgray @dcherring Yeah, next-level 🤣🤣
@teslaownersSV @chicago_glenn @stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Fasting + Ozempic/Wegovy + no tasty food near me
@chicago_glenn @stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Down 30 lbs!
@stevenmarkryan My apologies, this will be fixed within a week, two at most
@stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Agreed. What will matter in the future is how many Verified followers you have.
@teslaownersSV We’ll widen V11 beta before Thanksgiving
@dcherring @nichegamer Hard to say who’s celeb &amp; who isn’t. Being able to sort by follower count &amp; disallowing deliberate impersonation probably solves this.
@nichegamer All unpaid legacy Blue checkmarks will be removed in a few months
@RationalBlonde With new release, changing your verified name will cause loss of checkmark until name is confirmed by Twitter to meet Terms of Service
Punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid
@business False
@mrjasonchoi @nytimes Interesting thread
@SenBillNelson @NASA @SpaceX Much appreciated, SpaceX will not let NASA down!
Important to admit when I’m wrong &amp; firing them was truly one of my biggest mistakes
Welcoming back Ligma &amp; Johnson! https://t.co/LEhXV95Njj
@BillyM2k Actual Silicon Valley is way crazier!
@waitbutwhy This is just as a result of people living longer. Population collapse is already built-in, due to dramatically decreasing birth rates.
@elonchieftwit False
@mualphaxi @micsolana @JTLonsdale @SenMarkey Much appreciated
@presidentbison @schrep Schrep is great
@libsoftiktok A tragic case of adult onset Tourette’s
@catturd2 @WholeMarsBlog You make a compelling case
@micsolana The injustice of it all 😭😭
@ajtourville @unusual_whales Seriously
@chriskatje @unusual_whales Ligma &amp; Johnson are welcome back anytime
@unusual_whales I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.
@MuskUniversity (cue Obama giving himself a medal meme)
@MuskUniversity Exactly
@schrep Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.
@schrep True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced, but that can’t solve weak Internet connections &amp; older phones.

Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone.
@WholeMarsBlog Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space, so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website
@schrep There are ~1200 “microservices” server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team. 

Trimming down that 1200 number, reducing data usage, serialized trips &amp; simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use.
@schrep Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact, not “claim”.

10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes, it doesn’t work at all, especially on Android phones.

Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app.
@Umbisam Mr. Munger’s words are much appreciated
@minliangtan @wlopwangling Malenia battle was next-level intense
@minliangtan @wlopwangling Yes, although it seemed almost impossible at times
@waitbutwhy The ratings on this simulation are incredible
@wlopwangling Definitely
@Popeska @sampullara Why is Twitter unusably slow in many countries? Seems odd that this would be bandwidth only.
@micsolana Yeah, I hate it
By the People,
For the People
Twitter is All the News
@NASASpaceflight Next test is ~20 sec firing with max oxygen fill to test autogenous pressurization, possibly one more static fire, then orbital launch attempt
@NASASpaceflight Test went well
@TrungTPhan Why the puff piece @nytimes?
@WholeMarsBlog Good question
@cb_doge Did seem a little Dr Evil tbh haha
@alexeheath This is an external analysis, not from Twitter. It is lower than Twitter’s published mDAU.
@NASASpaceflight Full test duration of 14 engines
Recent trend is promising https://t.co/0q7UdxSkbM
@nichegamer @abhiharry726 @sampullara That’s what I said!
@abhiharry726 @sampullara In some parts of the world, refresh takes 30 seconds
@Popeska @sampullara How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?
@sampullara And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …
@sampullara Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!
@sampullara I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter, which matches # of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.

Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long), but ~20 secs in India, due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low.
@mishaboar @MattWallace888 That is not good
@SeagerKershaw @KoguanLeo @hiromichimizuno This is up to the Tesla board
@leandroruschel @rmotta2 Can you cite specific instances of significance?
@Alpsoy66 @EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd I have Tesla covered too. Will be there part of this week.
@dogeofficialceo @EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd That’s the bizarre part
@helvio @rmotta2 How was it proven?
@MattWallace888 Yay, he’s investing in Tesla!
@TaraBull808 @MarioNawfal @KimDotcom @RealChetBLong @favrue3 @cvpayne @AlderLaneEggs @bennyjohnson @catturd2 @RealCandaceO A question worth asking
@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd I’m ready through the list right now
@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd True, the food is great. 

The fact that you don’t realize that there are up to 1200 “microservices” being called when someone uses the Twitter app is not great.
@FBIPantyRaid @ThisIsKyleR Interesting
@rmotta2 It’s on my list to review. How urgent is this?
@SawyerMerritt That is my philosophy
@jimcramer @JohnLegere Umm … no
@chainsawdotcom @CL207 SpaceX Starlink bought a tiny – not large – ad package to test effectiveness of Twitter advertising in Australia &amp; Spain. Did same for FB/Insta/Google.
@NFTDannny @SawyerMerritt End of week
@Fwiz @SawyerMerritt Join Twitter!
@CL207 Comments in this thread had me rofl
@SawyerMerritt Something tells me this would work 🧠
@__SeriousGemini @dawallach @Jason That goes without saying 🤣
@dawallach @Jason BTC will make it, but might be a long winter
@johnjhacking Concerning
@ShooterMcKevin1 @MrHumanityGives Accurate assessment
@chicago_glenn @MrHumanityGives Great movie
@MrHumanityGives Are FB followed real?
@BillyM2k Damn
@gchahal Good summary!
@AnaPaulaVolei @GFiuza_Oficial Will look into it
@EricFrohnhoefer Twitter is super slow on Android. What have you done to fix that?
@EricFrohnhoefer Then please correct me. What is the right number?
@_hawko False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%, average occupancy below 10%.

There are more people preparing breakfast than eating breakfast.

They don’t even bother serving dinner, because there is no one in the building.
@dennishegstad Increasing granularity about what “verified” actually means is the right move
@lexfridman I think you’re great
@Tattytats @AmoneyResists I can’t tell
@nichegamer Especially bizarre given that almost no one came to the office. Estimated cost per lunch served in past 12 months is &gt;$400.
@HSajwanization I hope they keep cursing me on Twitter, as it increases advertising revenue!
@dennishegstad We will enable organizations to manage affiliations
@engineers_feed Output of any company is the vector sum of people within it. Someone may be a strong vector, but negatively affect those around them to such a degree that they are a net negative.
Btw, I’d like to apologize for Twitter being super slow in many countries. App is doing &gt;1000 poorly batched RPCs just to render a home timeline!
@jessica_kirsh @SpaceX @TeslaAIBot @Tesla Cool :)
@johnkrausphotos Ultimately, I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter, but I’m open to suggestions
Rolling out soon, Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them
@D4VIDBRAVO Coming soon
@sama Amphetamines negatively affect empathy, psychedelics do the opposite
@People4Bernie @SenMarkey @washingtonpost Are you suggesting the Senator will abuse his political power to attack me?
@BillyM2k Twitter rocks
@muratpak @archillect What matters is that you love them
Twitter feels increasingly alive
@JohnLegere @HolyKnightKeith @Twitter @MikeSievert @TMobile I like both you and Mike! It’s just that Twitter at its core is a software &amp; servers company. The technology needs to evolve rapidly, which requires a technologist.
@SenMarkey @washingtonpost And why does your pp have a mask!?
@SenMarkey @washingtonpost Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?
@BLKMDL3 @DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Rollout will broaden roughly every week
@ID_AA_Carmack Fond memories
@DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Probably next month
@DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Going without saying that we all want ASS (Actually Smart Summon) ASAP!!
@slashdot No way
@debarghya_das @ayushkhd @Tesla Making Tesla Superchargers &amp; connectors available to all is the right thing to do
@A_MrBenMitchell @RadioShack @MarioNawfal Spaces should be evolve. It has potential to be truly great.
@pauljamil @philbak1 Probably end of next week
@philbak1 My reaction to SBF was … different
@MarioNawfal Twitter at its best!
@balinares This is false. Anyone who can be in office, should be. However, if not logistically possible or they have essential personal matters, then staying home is fine.

Working remotely is also ok if their manager vouches for excellence.

Same policy as Tesla &amp; SpaceX.

@CathieDWood Exactly
@andst7 Cool
@WholeMarsBlog Given all that is in V11, it will take a few weeks to expand the beta, then another few weeks to go wide release to US &amp; Canada
@WholeMarsBlog FSD V11 rolled out at 11:11pm Pacific

@KimDotcom @sama Not sure I have much to add
FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter
@alexgilbertnz @TechEmails It’s coming
@TechEmails Accurate. He set off my bs detector, which is why I did not think he had $3B.
We’re adding a “Parody” subscript to clarify
@BernieSanders Full answer to insulin price question is complex. Short answer is that original insulin, discovered in 1921 (not 1923), is inexpensive, costing as little as $25. 

New, higher efficacy analog variants of insulin are more expensive. @CommunityNotes

https://t.co/S4c0esI1vU
@WholeMarsBlog It used to be:

“Internet guy will fail at rockets/cars!”

Now it is:

“Rockets/cars guy will fail at Internet!”

Literally from same media outlets 🤣🤣
@SawyerMerritt @BillyM2k @WholeMarsBlog Maybe should be default off? Subscriber is a way better name.
Mainstream media will still thrive, but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate, as their oligopoly on information is disrupted
@stillgray True
This is from the video arcade &amp; bar area
@EvaFoxU Interesting
As Twitter pursues the goal of elevating citizen journalism, media elite will try everything to stop that from happening
@JeffTutorials What is Quill?
Twitter HQ is great (this is a real pic) https://t.co/qjfOQCr533
@EvaFoxU @Reuters When @CommunityNotes rolls out worldwide, it will have a powerful impact on falsehoods
@Reuters False
@BTC_Archive Needs some tweaks, but overall proceeding well
@WholeMarsBlog Agreed, necessary change
Hit all-time high of active users today
@TeslaTomMY1 2023 will probably be tough, but my companies are positioned well
Some epically funny tweets 🤣🤣
@stillgray @EmmanuelMacron We will take action in this regard
Quite the day!
@WholeMarsBlog I agree
@stillgray Absolutely
To be more precise, accounts doing parody impersonations. Basically, tricking people is not ok.
Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name, not just in bio
@stoolpresidente Even I paid $8, no discount
Usage of Twitter continues to rise. One thing is for sure: it isn’t boring!
@DojaCat You should be able to change your name now
@gainzy222 I’d watch that movie 🍿
@kcoleman Community Notes is a gamechanger for improving accuracy on Twitter!
@BiasedGirl Far too many corrupt legacy Blue “verification” checkmarks exist, so no choice but to remove legacy Blue in coming months
@farzyness @Twitter Indeed
I love when people complain about Twitter … on Twitter 🤣🤣
@DJSnM I’m not seeing much spam in this reply
@Ki_PenYakki_ay Coming
@mcuban It’s working for me. That said, we can definitely make the verified mentions tab more usable.
@chhcalling What does a tosh look like?
Are you seeing far fewer bots/scams/spam?
@Teslaconomics It’s awesome 🫐
@DojaCat Pretty funny though 🤣🤣
@DojaCat Working on it!
@GooseWayn That’s coming
@Pentosh1 You’re welcome!
@micsolana Rollout of new verified Blue is intentionally limited just to iOS in a few countries with very little promotion. 

As we iron out issues, we will expand worldwide on all platforms.
@micsolana In days to come, we’ll add granularity to verified badge, such as organizational affiliation &amp; ID verification
@micsolana We are changing the text to say “Legacy Verified. Could be notable, but could also be bogus.”
@StarringShane Subscription Blue is better than legacy Blue. I switched over.
@PPathole The goal of Twitter DMs is to superset Signal
@eglyman @tryramp @Twitter Twitter is growing super fast. I hope it continues!!
@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k Hopefully, as soon as next week
@BillyM2k Totally agree!
@TOIPlus Nope, I was alway 🥜 !
@ZubyMusic Yeah
@lawrencekitema @SpaceNews_Inc Congratulations!
@SpaceNews_Inc Rockets that aren’t reusable have no future
@SciGuySpace Finally
Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. 

We will keep what works &amp; change what doesn’t.
Complaint hotline operator online! Please mention your complaints below.
@MKBHD Blue check will be the great leveler
@MKBHD I just killed it
@nichegamer Actual fun stuff FTW!!
@ID_AA_Carmack Should be noted that a significant percentage of these accounts are not real people, but some proportion are
@jasontoff This is super messed up. Unfortunately, many such things occurred at Twitter. Even worse was done in later years. 

Meaningful growth happens when utility &amp; entertainment value improve. That will be our focus going forward.

No more fake numbers &amp; pseudo growth.
@micsolana When reality is indistinguishable from satire
@monitoringbias It is borderline illegal to support Republicans in San Francisco! 

Even admitting you know some is pretty bad 🤣
@ZubyMusic Good point
@RustyRoad @ID_AA_Carmack Twitter is the most interesting place on the Internet
Twitter is the worst!
But also the best.
@stevekrenzel Wow, this is messed up!
@WholeMarsBlog Politics is war and truth is the first casualty
@PPathole @mayemusk While it’s true that I’ve been under unfair &amp; misleading attack for some time by leading Democrats, my motivation here is for centrist governance, which matches the interests of most Americans
@BillyM2k @laoisman80 @hankgreen Exactly
@yoyoel Important thread
I just hope the servers don’t melt!
Twitter usage is at an all-time high lol
And I’m open to the idea of voting Democrat again in the future
To be clear, my historical party affiliation has been Independent, with an actual voting history of entirely Democrat until this year
@MattWallace888 @hankgreen True
@hankgreen Like most people in America, I agree with some of the Democrat and some of the Republican policies, but not all.

However, if executive and legislative branches are dominated by *one* party, then we lose balance of power.
Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!
To independent-minded voters:

Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic.
But if Twitter is bird, that’s means … 🤯
Back when birds were real
How times have changed https://t.co/gCxUkZ4kZC
@TomFitton @Twitter We do
Twitter rules will evolve over time, but they’re currently the following: https://t.co/Ut1tXuefso
@greg16676935420 @jack Birds haven’t been real since 1986 https://t.co/lR6BZj0nwX
@mcuban $8 for all
@stillgray @jack Exactly
@jack Not everything needs to have “bird” in the name! Too many bird groups fighting each internally other at Twitter. Angry Birds.
@jack Birdwatch gives me the creeps
@SarahKSilverman Community Notes aka @birdwatch
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin But if she really wants her account back, she can have it
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin Actually, she was suspended for impersonating a comedian
@stillgray At the end of the day, if Twitter is indeed the most accurate source of information, more people will use it
@jack As judged by the people of Twitter via Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch)
@RationalEtienne @kylegrantham Absolutely
@kylegrantham You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information. That’s the big lie.
@realpfigueiredo @JosianoPadovani @reportersalles I will look into this
@stevenmarkryan Accurate
My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk
Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
@alex_avoigt Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced.

And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth, it will be indispensable.
@BillyM2k @StonksReddit No problem to use a pseudonym. The high-level principle is just that verified users can’t engage in malicious deception.
@EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation, as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization
Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
@catturd2 No exceptions
Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning. 

This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue.
@JosianoPadovani @reportersalles What censorship are you referring to?
Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying “parody” will be permanently suspended
@SnazzyQ @CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro We can beat that
@birdwatch Worth watching
@michaelmiraflor Fixing search is a high priority
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut Noted to fix
Search within Twitter reminds me of Infoseek in ‘98! That will also get a lot better pronto.
@CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro Interesting
@gchahal @TwitterBlue 42 mins to start, then several hours in a month or so
@BillyM2k @nikitabier We definitely need to incent people to do a lot more interactions on Twitter!
@Erdayastronaut We can do 42 min chunks at 1080 resolution now for new Blue, so you could break up a longer video. The 42 min limit should be fixed next month.

How does YouTube monetization work &amp; what could Twitter do better?
@stillgray Absolutely
@Cricprabhu Hopefully, less than a month
@AdamFostermusic Absolutely
@Jorge_Most_ Two weeks
@mahdi Something like that
Followed by creator monetization for all forms of content
Twitter will soon add ability to attach long-form text to tweets, ending absurdity of notepad screenshots
@aaroncohn30 @IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Couple months
@RenataKonkoly @raaahulpandey @TeslaAIBot True
@raaahulpandey Great question. Twitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money! 

So if scammers want to do this a million times, that’s just a whole bunch of free money. https://t.co/QUrxqb59I0
This rocks https://t.co/sB1sL0Hdrv
@ProfitsTaken So long as pay $8, please be my guest
@IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan That is weirdly tricky due to the way Apple handles “subscriptions”. If you subscribed to the old thing, it’s not super smooth to subscribe to the new thing. We’re working on it.
@MarkRuffalo Hot take: not everything AOC says is 💯 accurate
@scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan This feature is an absolute gamechanger for fighting mis/disinformation at scale
@SirineAti @BillyM2k As soon as we confirm it’s working well in the initial set of countries and we have the translation work done, it will roll out worldwide
@Tesmanian_com Making great actuators for a humanoid robot is a surprisingly hard problem
@alex_avoigt I still do a lot of work at Tesla! Was at our Palo Alto engineering office until late Thursday night when I had to redeye to NY.
@BillyM2k Far too many legacy “verified” checkmarks were handed out, often arbitrarily, so in reality they are *not* verified. You can buy as many as you want right now with a Google search.

Piggybacking off payment system plus Apple/Android is a much better way to ensure verification.
@Techgnostik @alex_avoigt Correct
@kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Birdwatch (soon to be renamed Community Notes) has incredible potential for improving information accuracy on Twitter!
Trash me all day, but it’ll cost $8
⚡️⚡️⚡️ Power to the People ⚡️⚡️⚡️
@CryptoDaddyTV I try my best
@mrddmia Thank you. 

A thermonuclear name &amp; shame is exactly what will happen if this continues.
Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.

Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required.
@TomFitton @Twitter @yoyoel @JudicialWatch Twitter will not censor accurate information about anything
Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.

In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press.
Excellent summary of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety from the head of the team
@hankgreen Hank, try a Google search …
@ZssBecker Agreed. Working on it.
@hankgreen And therefore Twitter should die?
@stillgray You’re right
Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.

Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.
@WalterIsaacson Absolutely
@TomFitton That assessment is more accurate than most people realize
@waitbutwhy Unsure if confirming or denying that 
I’m an alien is more convincing that 
I’m an alien
@Plinz maybe we’re already in it
@waitbutwhy I’m an alien trying to get back to my home planet
@varmentmobile @POTUS There are in fact 2 agendas
Tiny talk is talk so small it feels like it’s coming from your own mind
@bennyjohnson @AOC What can I say? It was a naked abuse of power.
Why is small talk even legal!?
A neuron doesn’t realize it’s a neuron
@CookieCrumb35 Pretty much, or at least one of the hive minds
… with a lot of room for improvement
Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic super-intelligence
@AliZafarsays @MrBeast True, Twitter has amazing content in Japan – roughly half of all adults online – but it’s almost never seen outside of Japan
@AOC Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8
Advertisers should support:
Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the Internet. That’s why you’re reading this tweet right now.
@RealSpikeCohen The system is working 🤣
Being attacked by both right &amp; left simultaneously is a good sign
@TrungTPhan Quite a few companies like this
@BillyM2k Works every time
@cafreiman @micsolana Capital allocation should be done by those best at doing so
@TesLatino @Tesla Still a fair bit of polish to be done on 69.3. It’s a major release posing as a minor release.
@adrianhon Some good ideas here
you get what you pay for
@Rubiu5 If verified accounts violate terms of service, eg spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!

We will definitely add cool stuff like what you’re suggesting to Twitter Blue.
@MichaelDell Thanks Michael
@bennyjohnson Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints
@HSajwanization Exactly!
@micsolana The community notes feature is awesome. 

Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth, without regard to political affiliation.
@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter's content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views, which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence
@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks
@yoyoel Talked to civil society leaders @JGreenblattADL, @YaelEisenstat, @rashadrobinson, @JGo4Justice, @normanlschen, @DerrickNAACP, @TheBushCenter Ken Hersch &amp; @SindyBenavides about how Twitter will continue to combat hate &amp; harassment &amp; enforce its election integrity policies
@foundmyfitness I think so
@klwtts Exactly!
Twitter speaks to the inner masochist in all of us
@TomFitton @Twitter @yoyoel It’s the user’s own setting that did this
Totally stole idea of charging for insults &amp; arguments from Monty Python tbh https://t.co/oFKRyp3BS7
To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8
@Rubiu5 That already happens very frequently
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceForceDoD @SLDelta45 @SpaceX Falcon Heavy is a testament to the awesomeness of humanity
@Jihoz_Axie Sounds like a good idea
There will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure, which is already the case for politicians
@saylor Yes, this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam/scam, that account will be suspended. 

Essentially, this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude.
@Gfilche Absolutely essential. Creators need to make a living!
This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators
@Emmonspired @MKBHD Exactly
And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us
You will also get:
- Priority in replies, mentions &amp; search, which is essential to defeat spam/scam
- Ability to post long video &amp; audio
- Half as many ads
Price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity
Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. 

Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.
Sonic BOOMS!!
Falcon Heavy launch in ~30 mins
@StephenKing I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots &amp; trolls.
@StephenKing We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?

@ksadjadpour Cool
@DavidSacks 🤣🤣 

Although there could be more R&amp;D in candy tbh. Feels like there hasn’t been much improvement in decades.
@WholeMarsBlog Headline is misleading. Starlink can obviously offer far more robust positioning than GPS, as it will have ~1000X more satellites over time. 

Not all will have line of sight to users, but still &gt;10X GPS &amp; far stronger signal.

Just not today’s problem.

@teslaownersSV @BillyM2k Varies a lot. Tesla &amp; SpaceX are in good positions, but many other companies are not. 

Recessions do have a silver lining in that companies that shouldn’t exist stop existing.
@RenataKonkoly @ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Those who want Putin removed are laboring under the misapprehension that whoever replaces him will be more amenable to peace or western philosophy, but I think this is unlikely – the Kremlin is not the Nice Guy Olympics
@ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region, perhaps the world
@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k If Russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically critical as Crimea, the probability of using nuclear weapons is high
@jamesplloyd @SpaceX I do. Yes.
@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Still very unlikely, but this is the closest we’ve been since Cuba in ‘62
@teslaownersSV @BillyM2k Just guessing, but probably until spring of ‘24

@PPathole @EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome – just a question of how much death &amp; destruction happens before then
@gaborgurbacs @EvaFoxU @DavidSacks That should be the nature of the debate
@EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys Ukraine &amp; severely damages Russia, with massive body count on both sides.

And, in the end, the same outcome. 

So why?
@DavidSacks Exactly

@alex_avoigt No money from DoD, but several other countries, orgs &amp; individuals are paying for ~11k/25k terminals (thanks!).

@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX To be precise, 25,300 terminals were sent to Ukraine, but, at present, only 10,630 are paying for service
@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding
@starrski71 @RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Wrong analogy. America also had a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one in America sees that country as part of America.

Crimea *is* seen as a crucial part of Russia by Russia, much as Hawaii is seen as a crucial part of America.
@PPathole @spideycyp_155 Probably not
@zerohedge Practice makes perfect …
@RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine. 

But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total, humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high.
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Obviously many disagree with this logic, but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3. 

If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools.
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise.
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over
@spideycyp_155 Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia. 

Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.

From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor.
@hyiki22 @spideycyp_155 Exactly
@spideycyp_155 If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.

We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose? 

If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3.
Exceptionally well-said
@rhensing @keith_dorschner @teslaownersSV Standard (non-performance) 3 &amp; Y suspension in production now has improved comfort, without affecting handling
@DrKnowItAll16 @pirate3Guy @HSerunjogi Yeah, RV version is lower priority than standard version. 

You should still see high speeds during off hours. Is that happening?

As we add more satellites &amp; upgrade satellite technology, speeds in high user density locations should see significant increases.
Ok, we will add a donate option to Starlink
@pirate3Guy @HSerunjogi That’s oddly low. Normally, much higher.
Are there others that want to donate Starlinks to places in need?
@DogecoinNorway @moxie @ID_AA_Carmack 🤣 that’s happened to me many times

@RaheemKassam The hilarious thing is you’re not wrong 🤣
@EvaFoxU So it goes …
@gainzy222 Fate loves irony
@DavidSacks Even so, we should still do good deeds
The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free
@Brian_J_Berger That dude is not just a “condition of anonymity” spineless coward, he’s also an ignorant fool. Starlink was directly requested by the Ukraine government, as it was the only thing that worked.
@spideycyp_155 @PPathole @ashleevance It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war.
@ashleevance DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context.
@PPathole @ashleevance Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.
@ashleevance The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesn’t work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does.
@ajtourville Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.

In any given year, there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.

https://t.co/hSqNeYHNX1
@WholeMarsBlog Curses, foiled again!
@mtaibbi Accurate
@ajtourville Russia has the ability to destroy USA &amp; Europe utterly with nuclear missiles in less than 30 minutes &amp; vice versa.

A surprising number of people don’t know this.

Of course, it would be MAD to use them, but it is also MAD to be in this situation at all.
@nichegamer This has potential
@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Internet fiber, phone lines, cell towers &amp; other space-based comms in war areas have been destroyed. 

Starlink is all that’s left. For now.

https://t.co/CdjbOWgziz
@FedorovMykhailo Thank you for clarifying this 💙🇺🇦💛
@StonksReddit @rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Starlink is the primary communications system of the Ukrainian army on the war front. If anyone else wants this job, please be my guest …
@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms. 

Starlink is only comms system still working at warfront – others all dead. 

Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink. To safeguard, SpaceX has diverted massive resources towards defense.

Even so, Starlink may still die.
@EvaFoxU @Nobody_Really7 @EvaKBartlett Concerning
@stillgray Are there citizens of nations who are helping Ukraine on this list?
@ajtourville But surely no reasonable person would launch nuclear war?

The problem with that logic is if we were dealing with reasonable people, we wouldn’t have war in the first place.
@EvaKBartlett Is this list real? What’s the URL?
@Rainmaker1973 People should never fear turbulence. Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.
@mtaibbi The right question to ask
@officejjsmart @MelnykAndrij We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️
@narutium @SawyerMerritt Falcon can probably get Starlink past breakeven, but Starship is needed to fund Mars
@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain &amp; replenish satellites &amp; ground stations &amp; pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways. 

We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks &amp; jamming, which are getting harder.

Burn is approaching ~$20M/month.
@SawyerMerritt Also, Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.

When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference, I said “not go bankrupt”.
@BogusThought @SawyerMerritt @rfdctr Maybe the 🐈 got their 👅
@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @rfdctr @SpaceX Very few in Iran so far
@SawyerMerritt Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch &amp; communications, Lockheed &amp; Boeing, who get over $60B …

Wouldn’t be surprised to find this particular individual working there when he retires from DoD. Corruption at its finest.
@SawyerMerritt @rfdctr SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable.
@MuskUniversity Vital to the future of consciousness

This operation has cost SpaceX $80M &amp; will exceed $100M by end of year.

As for what’s happening on the battlefield, that’s classified.

@stillgray @atrupar @LindseyGrahamSC There are no angels in war.
@EliClifton @DavidSacks Accurate assessment
@garyblack00 Correct
@stevenmarkryan So they’re saying that not buying Twitter is bad, but also buying Twitter is bad!?
@LucidTrading_ @DavidSacks We talked via videoconference last year
War is the ultimate Supreme Court
@bdquinn @LindseyGrahamSC Kherson and Zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join Russia – annexation of those regions was done to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea
@LindseyGrahamSC Obviously, not everyone who voted for the pro-Russia party wanted to join Russia, but it would also be inaccurate to say that none did.
@LindseyGrahamSC Below is the electoral map of 2012. Blue is the pro-Russia party. https://t.co/YkZ9hipyAV
@LindseyGrahamSC Assuming you believe that the will of the people matters, we should, in any given conflict region, support the will of those who live there. 

Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine, but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia.
@LindseyGrahamSC First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years &amp; we didn’t ask for this one – GM &amp; Ford did

@TEDchris Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy vision
@KonstantinKisin I do not think it is simple at all, but I have yet to hear any realistic path to peace.

Ukraine has achieved many brilliant tactical victories, but should be wary of overconfidence leading to strategic defeat.

When Russia fully mobilizes, millions on both sides will die.
@WholeMarsBlog 10.69.3 will actually be a major upgrade. We’re keeping .69 just because haha.
@LarckeningXuruo Twitter probably accelerates X by 3 to 5 years, but I could be wrong
Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app
@SawyerMerritt Should be noted that Starlink is still far from cash flow positive. All LEO communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt, so any support is super helpful.
@FrenchyRagin @Kasparov63 A small number of terminals were paid for by the govt, vast majority were not. This is just another bs WaPo hit piece.
@ZelenskyyUa I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world.
@Kasparov63 We gave Starlinks to Ukraine &amp; lost $80M+ in doing so, while putting SpaceX &amp; myself at serious risk of Russian cyberattack.

What have you done besides tweet?
@DavidSacks SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable &amp; support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.

Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail &amp; risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine &amp; Earth.
@slashdot In other news, remote controlled anal beads sold out everywhere
@spideycyp_155 @StonksReddit @Podolyak_M That referendum was questionable, which is why I suggested repeating it under UN (or other trusted entity) supervision
@StonksReddit @Podolyak_M Great, offer a UN supervised vote and if Russia refuses, then war it is
@Podolyak_M Maybe a similar approach to Kosovo https://t.co/cGPpaXAaA3
@Podolyak_M No, I’m suggesting voting under UN (or pick your most trusted entity or country) supervision
@RenataKonkoly Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.

Russia has &gt;3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace.
@RenataKonkoly You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care.

I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome.
Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas &amp; Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine
@PopMech Cheese is amazing
@Nemli_mot Indeed. Biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.
@raulsanchezuk The bot attack on this poll is strong!
@AkiKivirinta The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine, but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine
Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war
This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then
Ukraine-Russia Peace:

- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

- Water supply to Crimea assured.

- Ukraine remains neutral.
@jasondebolt That is my assessment too
@tim_zaman Well-said! Also, we try to operate the team as non-hierarchically as possible &amp; allow movement between project areas, so you don’t get pigeon-holed.

@teslaownersSV Yeah
Why it is vital to solve the deficit

@Noahpinion @devahaz Fuck you, I’m not a liar. You are.
Beautiful
Cool
@rpoo Yeah
True
This email is a very basic pulse check
The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!

In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used
This is a trivial task
@seanonolennon Yeah
A large number of good responses have been received already. These are the people who should be considered for promotion.
Try @Grok voice mode and personalities
An incredible week!
@VigilantSailor Yes, strange indeed
Indeed, this takes less than 5 mins
Exactly
@bayeslord But have you tried Grok? 😂
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
To be clear, the bar is very low here. 

An email with some bullet points that make any sense at all is acceptable!

Should take less than 5 mins to write.
@SenTinaSmith What did you get done last week?
Grok voice early beta is now available on the @Grok app. 

This is early beta, so expect issues (that will be resolved fast), but it’s still awesome.
That would be a very impressive and long list indeed for you!

However, the passing grade is literally just “Can you send an email with words that make any sense at all?”. 

It’s a low bar.
This will be fun 🚀🚀

How many more years of death in trenches and billions of

@Acyn This Community Note is false. 

SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back last year, but Biden pushed the return past the inauguration date. 

Legacy media is NOT a reliable source.
The most out-of-the-box thinking is realizing you’re trapped in a box created by others. 

Only then can you escape the box to another box.

Legacy media are mostly just puppets, with massive influence by the state.

Thanks, Ari! ❤️ https://t.co/BUrm2trh4e
Fundamental to the Scientific Method is that the “science” is always subject to question and never settled!

Upon reexamination, we will discover that, in some cases, long-accepted “scientific wisdom” was wrong.
Btw, you can improve the graphics resolution simply by asking Grok to do so. 

We’re working on being able to integrate photo-realistic graphics into AI games for the @xAI game studio.

If Caruso, who is very competent, had been elected mayor, he would have saved thousands of homes that are now gone.

No question. 

Competence in elected officials matters.
This is a deliberate strategy by Democrats to use government handouts to attract and retain illegal immigrants, as illegals vote overwhelmingly Democrat. 

In New York and many other parts of the country, illegals are alreadt allowed to vote in local elections.

Major improvement in Treasury payment integrity going live!

This was a combined effort of @DOGE, @USTreasury and @FederalReserve. Nice work by all.
@Geiger_Capital It would be cool for the public to see what so much gold looks like. It is theirs, after all!

Hopefully, the storage facility has above zero style.
My rough estimate is that it’s ~80% lack of competence/caring and ~20% fraud. 

But that’s still a lot of fraud!
This is what competent leadership looks like
@libsoftiktok This would be super cool
@SenFettermanPA I love the people. We just want to fix the waste and fraud that is bankrupting the country. 

The scrutiny on me is extreme, so it’s not like I could “get away” with something, nor do I have any incentive to do so.
This gold is the property of the American people. I sure hope it’s still there!

The REAL reason so many Democrats are upset about entitlements (social security, medical, etc) fraud investigations is that they are using your taxpayer money as handouts to attract and retain ILLEGAL immigrants. Their future voters. 

That’s what it’s all about.

Truth.
Bruh, if I wanted to rummage through random personal shit, I could have done that at PAYPAL. Hello???

Having tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as “ALIVE” when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. 

Obviously.

Some of these people would have been alive https://t.co/6hBqAJ5TbF
@BullMooseMemes I think this is the last chance for Germany
@glennbeck @BasedMikeLee Yeah!
Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox? 

Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not. 

That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there.
@LauraLoomer @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump They are going way too far. A man was actually murdered by Luigi and they tried to kill the President twice. 

This is not ok at all.
@LauraLoomer @LoomerUnleashed Advocating murder of the President is a serious crime and they have the gall to do so on President’s Day!

Letting @EagleEdMartin know about this.
What @DOGE is doing is similar to Clinton/Gore Dem policies of the 1990s.

The current Dem party has just gone so crazy far left that it isn’t recognizable anymore!

No more mooching off the taxpayer for them.
The logic flow diagram for the Social Security system looks INSANE. No one person actually knows how it works. 

The payment files that move between Social Security and Treasury have significant inconsistencies that are not reconciled. It’s wild.

The probability of a trans person being violent appears to be vastly higher than non-trans. 

Hormone injections cause extreme emotional volatility. That is simply a fact.

@charliekirk11 Great!
Another abuse of your taxpayer money has ended
@nicksortor Not exactly killed their plans. 

No ID is required to vote in New York, so they will now continue using non-citizen votes illegally. 

But it will be harder.
They tried hard to legalize non-citizen voting in New York and just failed. 

Now, they will try to keep doing it illegally. 

Voter ID is still banned in New York and California!

@BillyM2k The only thing keeping the other orbital rocket programs alive is government protection or they’d be deader than a doornail and everyone knows it. 

But oh well … comme ci, comme ça.
@BillyM2k The super weird thing is that Falcon 9 is still the only orbital booster to land or refly after all these years!
@Erdayastronaut @IzanRamos2002 @Caspar_Stanley Yes, about 20% more thrust &amp; 20% less mass, but focus has been heavily on production rate &amp; reliability.

Mass, thrust &amp; Isp will all improve, as will production rate, reliability &amp; cost.

This is the only way to make life multi-planetary and extend consciousness into the void.

@teslaownersSV @PPathole @breezefps The Bay Area is already saturated with user terminals, which is why wait time for a terminal is long. 

Rush hour speeds will improve as more satellites reach operational orbits, with a giant improvement with V2 sats. 

Note, speeds outside of rush hour times should be very high.
@PPathole @breezefps Best outcome would be to route packets from Starlink user terminal to ground station on roof of server center. 

Then it doesn’t even touch the regular Internet.

@EvaFoxU Exactly
@breezefps Starlink inter-satellite laser links should be operational by end of year. This will dramatically reduce global latency.

Also, FSD Beta 10.12.2 now expanding to 100k cars. 

10.13 smooths out intersection control, especially long lefts, and starts to handle roads with no map data at all. 

Last point is a big deal. Within a few months, FSD should be able to drive to a GPS point with zero map data.

@PPathole 70 is currently the age when you receive maximum social security benefits. In other words, that’s when the govt concludes that you can’t hold a job!!
@PPathole Open primaries sound like a good way to move candidates to be more centrist.

Term limits help with the gerontocracy problem, but, frankly, there should be a max age beyond which you can’t run (maybe 70?), just like there are min ages for house, senate &amp; president.
@VW @Tesla Thanks, and also well done to you for advancing electric vehicles!
@ExplainThisBob Once again, Bob nails it.

Yes, I am endorsing a political candidate because he is competent!
It is rare for me to endorse political candidates. 

My political leanings are moderate, so neither fully Republican nor Democrat, which I am confident is the case for most Americans.

Executive competence is super underrated in politics – we should care about that a lot more!

@teslaownersSV @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ The Democrat vs Republican tribalism among otherwise intelligent people is most distressing.

Demonizing everyone who would vote for an alternate party is not constructive.
@PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil &amp; gas industry.

The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie’s donation to PACs posing as charities.
@KimDotcom I would be shocked if I’m *not* being spied on haha. 

My only ask is that anyone spying on me please not affect call quality too much or I can’t hear what’s being said!
@Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ I’m just talking about the mid-term elections in November. Not sure that there is a third party candidate.

@HardDriveMag The reason you’re not that funny is because you’re woke. 

Humor relies on an intuitive &amp; often awkward truth being recognized by the audience, but wokism is a lie, which is why nobody laughs.
@HardDriveMag Less funny than SNL on a bad day. This could make a drunk person sober. Try harder!
@PPathole @jack Still early stages on that. Getting Starship reliably to orbit, then achieving full &amp; immediate reusability of both stages is by far top priority.
@jack 2029 feels like a pivotal year. I’d be surprised if we don’t have AGI by then. Hopefully, people on Mars too.
@HardDriveMag Well, if you make something that looks like a meme &amp; someone (not me) crops off your name, so it goes.

Also, this is only a 6/10 meme, so maybe step down from that high horse!

The selfless art of anonymous meme creators is something to be admired.
@truth_tesla @MadeInTheUSANJ Yeah, the public has no idea how much Tesla and SpaceX have been attacked/undermined, because we aren’t unionized (yet offer highest pay in industry!) and this administration would rather a company be dead than not unionized
@karpathy I couldn’t agree more! There is such a thing as too much sentience for household appliances.

Imagine giving advanced AI to a toilet with an implicit “maximize 💩” utility function, so it engages in deep societal manipulation just to get maximum 💩 haha.
@MadeInTheUSANJ I support free speech, but not any one candidate. In fact, I gave money to &amp; voted for Hillary &amp; then voted for Biden.

However, given unprovoked attacks by leading Democrats against me &amp; a very cold shoulder to Tesla &amp; SpaceX, I intend to vote Republican in November.

Many insightful comments in the mentions
@westcoastbill For sure
@uniteCOforus @thebradfordfile Yeah, I think that’s probably right. If it were up to me, I would delete charitable deduction. And class-action lawsuits.
@wanda_hudson @TomFitton @AJDelgado13 I think this would actually work
@TheTeslaBull @BLKMDL3 @S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC Based on past experience, about 12 to 18 months. Companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources.
@andymilonakis Fair
@SmileSimplify @AOC I’m genuinely curious
@BLKMDL3 @S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.

Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!
@StrategistSpace @IWill_Travel @AOC That would be awesome
@S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC This would be a super bad idea, since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next, eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH!

However, eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good, since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower.
@IWill_Travel @AOC The degree to which the unions control the Dems is insane. It’s like watching a sock puppet “talk”, but the hand inside the sock is way too obvious!
.@aoc I dare you to run the same poll with your followers
@PinkVillaArts In general, very true
Who do you trust less? Real question.
@Dilbert_Daily Curses!
@HordeTrooper A union is just another corporation. Far better for many companies to compete for your skills, so that you have maximum optionality.

@davidgokhshtein Dogecoin Trillionaire, the Movie 🍿
Use of the word “billionaire” as a pejorative is morally wrong &amp; dumb 😛
@BillyM2k Yeah
@wanda_hudson @TomFitton @AJDelgado13 Maybe just require homicide insurance for a gun purchase? Minimum car insurance, which is basically homocide insurance, is required for car ownership.
Almost ten years ago
@JohnnaCrider1 @TomFitton @AJDelgado13 There is a sergeant making judgment calls about recruits before giving them a weapon, so that’s a reasonable barrier
@TomFitton @AJDelgado13 How about a middle ground, where the licensing standard for semi-auto rifles is a driver’s license, age 21 and no rap sheet? 

Basically, what is a reasonable way to make it harder for people with homicidal impulses to obtain body count maximizing weapons?
@AJDelgado13 To be more precise, I mean any semi-automatic gun with supersonic ammo and a large magazine
@JayinShanghai I have so much respect for the Tesla Shanghai team

@JaneidyEve @stevenmarkryan If I were to own Twitter, it would be geared towards the middle 80% of the population, so technically the far left and far right would probably be dissatisfied
@RustyRoad @teslaownersSV @RyanGirdusky @GoodPoliticGuy Human are absurdly concentrated on a tiny percentage of Earth’s surface. That’s why people in cities think Earth is “full” of people, when in fact it is basically empty.
@NetflixIsAJoke @rickygervais Great show!
@stevenmarkryan If Twitter was not truthful here, what else is not true? This is very concerning news.
@Ryanth3nerd @stevenmarkryan Exactly

@mtaibbi Exactly
@WholeMarsBlog Indeed I did. 

However, I also think that Tesla has the potential to be the most valuable company ever. 

When Tesla’s market cap, making sustainable energy products, exceeds that of Aramco, producing fossil fuels, you know the future will be good for Earth.
@teslaownersSV The Iron Man statue was given to SpaceX because part of Iron Man 2 was filmed in the rocket factory

Population collapse is the biggest threat to civilization
@RyanGirdusky @GoodPoliticGuy Exactly!
@Sachinettiyil Definitely
@BillyM2k Then why is it that the richer someone is, the fewer kids they have?
Contrary to what many think, the richer someone is, the fewer kids they have.

I am a rare exception. Most people I know have zero or one kid.

@DBurkland Yeah
@teslaownersSV @micarrdc Should be proportionate to electricity prices. Is this not the case?
@micarrdc It’s accurate to say that incentives were an accelerant to EV adoption, but we started Tesla when there were no incentives &amp; gasoline was $2/gallon even in California.

Tesla currently has a tax credit *disadvantage*, because the $7500 tax credit stopped applying to us years ago.

@teslaownersSV @WholeMarsBlog No, they still refuse to explain how they calculate that 5% of daily users are fake/spam! Very suspicious.
@WholeMarsBlog I’m worried that Twitter has a disincentive to reduce spam, as it reduces perceived daily users
@ProfMJCleveland @ABCWorldNews @telsa Why is @abcnews ignoring this story?
@JanJekielek @Shem_Infinite @EpochTimes @themarketswork @JasperFakkert Confusing-gate, more like it!

Bottom line: A prominent lawyer working for the Clinton campaign fabricated Russia-Trump collusion using a retired MI6 spy &amp; some actual Russians. This is not ok!

There may have been actual Russian interference, but still the above is not cool.

@truth_tesla @veespike @HillaryClinton @Twitter Whether other senior campaign managers were aware or not is a separate question.

What is *not* in question is that Sussmann charged the Clinton Campaign for his Russia hoax meeting with the FBI.

Source document:
https://t.co/61C8L9isIU
@Shem_Infinite I only heard about it last month and was blown away
@TheCryptoDaddi @Block0nex @Jim_Jordan I am indeed out for blood
@truth_tesla @veespike @HillaryClinton @Twitter ??

Sussmann himself admitted billing Clinton Campaign to pay for him to present Russia hoax to FBI! This is not even questioned by the defense.

Btw, I donated to &amp; voted for Hillary, so am doubly pissed off about those funds being used for lying.

https://t.co/PtFgYzpXQN
@WhatsupFranks @veespike @HillaryClinton @Twitter Doesn’t exactly scream “trustworthy”
@veespike @HillaryClinton @Twitter .@paraga and @vijaya, what say you?
@veespike @HillaryClinton @Twitter You are absolutely correct. That tweet is a Clinton campaign hoax for which their campaign lawyer is undergoing a criminal trial. https://t.co/avtjEdthmA
@Jim_Jordan All true. 

Bet most people still don’t know that a Clinton campaign lawyer, using campaign funds, created an elaborate hoax about Trump and Russia. 

Makes you wonder what else is fake. 

 https://t.co/avtjEdthmA

@jonfavs Hi Jon! You’re a good dude, but obv die-hard Dem, so have to support the party, but this Adminstration has done everything it can to sideline &amp; ignore Tesla, even though we have made twice as many EVs as rest of US industry combined.
@catturd2 They began brewing attacks of all kinds as soon as the Twitter acquisition was announced.

In my 30 year career, including the entire MeToo era, there’s nothing to report, but, as soon as I say I intend to restore free speech to Twitter &amp; vote Republican, suddenly there is …
@jrdavidmitchell True (sigh)
Finally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It’s kinda perfect. 🤣
@teslaownersSV @JohnnaCrider1 @TaraBull808 No, it was clear that their only goal was a hit price to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me.
@JohnnaCrider1 @TaraBull808 Exactly. Moreover, the “friend” in question who gave the interview to BI, is a far left activist/actress in LA with a major political axe to grind.
@TaraBull808 But I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me “exposed” – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened.
@TaraBull808 And, for the record, those wild accusations are utterly untrue
The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech
@TaraBull808 Exactly
@EvaFoxU I’m trying! Nice meme.
To be clear, I’m spending &lt;5% (but actually) of my time on the Twitter acquisition. It ain’t rocket science!

Yesterday was Giga Texas, today is Starbase. Tesla is on my mind 24/7.

@WholeMarsBlog This is a big one! Expect some two steps forward, one step back situations. These will be great ironed in point releases, hence ~10.12.2 or 10.13 for wider beta release.
A party more moderate on all issues than either Reps or Dems would be ideal

In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party.

But they have become the party of division &amp; hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.

Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold … 🍿
@BillyM2k Pretty much. The dirty tricks attacks will be next-level.
@thehowie I’m not surprised at all. That was to inoculate the public. As a prominent vaccine advocate, you should understand that.

Yale is the epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization.

@EricBalchunas ESG is an outrageous scam!

@occupymars42069 @paraga Interesting
@Andst7 @paraga Seems like Twitter should welcome external validation if their claims are true
@Teslarati 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.

Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of &lt;5%.

This deal cannot move forward until he does.
@paul_griffiths This transcription isn’t precise, but gets the gist of it
@jarokrolewski Just a scratch really
@paraga So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.
@paraga Have you tried just calling them?
@BillyM2k Billy is the best

@SPKolten @heyitsyashu I don’t have much choice. Provided they don’t explicitly say that I endorse something, there is no legal recourse.

Not to mention potential bugs in the code. Open source is the way to go to solve both trust and efficacy.
I’m not suggesting malice in the algorithm, but rather that it’s trying to guess what you might want to read and, in doing so, inadvertently manipulate/amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening
@StrivenB @BLKMDL3 @PPathole That’s a deep cut (sigh)
@MODL3PILOT @coffeetabletsla @PPathole @Twitter Yes, that would have a big impact!
@coffeetabletsla @PPathole @Twitter With usernames like that, the bots aren’t even trying hard!
@BLKMDL3 @PPathole There is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users, which is the metric that matters to advertisers.

Very odd that the most popular tweets of all time were only liked by ~2% of daily active users.
@PPathole Exactly. I have yet to see *any* analysis that has fake/spam/duplicates at &lt;5%.

@DBurkland Team is working the weekend to get 10.12 in limited release tomorrow. Then we evaluate, do a point update, and broaden the release. 10.12.2 is probably where we can expand to a safety score of 95+.
At least, that’s what the lib hivemind thinks haha
Whoever thought owning the libs would be cheap never tried to acquire a social media company!
The bots are angry at being counted 🤣
@PPathole @Twitter Any sensible random sampling process is fine. If many people independently get similar results for % of fake/spam/duplicate accounts, that will be telling.

I picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate &lt;5% fake/spam/duplicate.
@fintwit_news @Twitter I relied upon the accuracy of Twitter’s public filings
@stevenmarkryan @teslaownersSV @Twitter Interesting
@teslaownersSV @Twitter If we collectively try to figure out the bot/duplicate user percentage, we can probably crowdsource a good answer
@teslaownersSV @Twitter Ignore first 1000 followers, then pick every 10th. I’m open to better ideas.
@coffeetabletsla @Twitter Pick any account with a lot of followers
To find out, my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of @twitter. 

I invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover …
@BillyM2k The axiomatic error was that housing prices only go up. I don’t support predatory lending, but many of those lenders were severely wounded or didn’t survive.

@squawksquare Also, as mentioned before, we will try to keep as many shareholders as legally possible in privately held Twitter!
@slashdot Apple’s store is like having a 30% tax on the Internet. Definitely not ok.
@dogecoin_empire I was going full Looney Tunes haha
@teslaownersSV @28delayslater Tesla is now over 110k direct jobs and roughly 500k indirect, factoring in suppliers
@28delayslater Talked to an NPC with aggro==255
@heydave7 Starlink is awesome for RV’s, camping or any activity away from cities
@WholeMarsBlog That is why we must clear out bots, spam &amp; scams. Is something actually public opinion or just someone operating 100k fake accounts? Right now, you can’t tell.

And algorithms must be open source, with any human intervention clearly identified.

Then, trust will be deserved.
@WholeMarsBlog There is so much potential with Twitter to be the most trusted &amp; broadly inclusive forum in the world!
@daelmor Yeah, kids starting with lots of money usually have much less motivation than those who have nothing. 

When we started our first company (Zip2) in 95, I had over $100k of student debt, a computer I built myself and a few thousand dollars.
@Kristennetten They will say anything to shift support away from me. Think of it as information war, not normal dialogue.
@stats_feed Time to make life multiplanetary
@BillyM2k @CoinDesk @SECGov @jackschickler Or twitter
@BillyM2k @cb_doge Can only read one side. Looks like “ax the itch”?
@cb_doge Making funny faces at the Met
@catturd2 I saw you trending as twitter ceo 🤣
@RationalEtienne @tomselliott @mehdirhasan Hey, why are they already writing my suicide story!?
As I was saying … https://t.co/tsGz6fCWuW
@RenataKonkoly @ggreenwald Haha 💯
@RenataKonkoly @ggreenwald All’s well that’s Orwell
the elusive beauty of imperfection

侘寂
@PPathole @kr0mb0pul0smike @RationalEtienne @tomselliott @mehdirhasan That is exactly the question
@kr0mb0pul0smike @RationalEtienne @tomselliott @mehdirhasan That’s a Vanity Fair party and she photobombed me in the background, but you know that already, don’t know?
@RationalEtienne @tomselliott @mehdirhasan Where is their “client” list? Shouldn’t at least one of them go down!?
@tomselliott @mehdirhasan NBC basically saying Republicans are Nazis …
@GerberKawasaki Will do our best
@engineers_feed Sphincter valve?
@pmarca I wonder what the world be like if Ludendorff hadn’t sent Lenin a train
@pmarca Sell Shadow Crew merch to buy Twitter?
@pmarca My Shadrow Crew is sickkk!
Also, who are they again?
@waitbutwhy By mass, Earth is composed of ~32% Iron. Next most common element by mass is oxygen at ~30%, but only a small portion of that is in the atmosphere.
@Rainmaker1973 An amazing example of what implanted electrodes can do, even when there are only a few large wires
@pmarca Haha he says “Bitcoin” so many times
Since I’ve been asked a lot:

Buy stock in several companies that make products &amp; services that *you* believe in.

Only sell if you think their products &amp; services are trending worse. Don’t panic when the market does.

This will serve you well in the long-term.
@vallioo @pmarca Munger is correct
@TheCaptain_Nemo @pmarca Major problem. Passive/index managers should vote in the best interests of shareholders, not shift responsibility to proxy advisory firms.
@pegobry @pmarca Exactly. Right before he died, Jack Bogle (of Vanguard fame) said index/passive funds were too great a percentage of the market and he really knew what he was talking about! 

There should be a shift back towards active investment. Passive has gone too far.
@pmarca Exactly, decisions are being made on behalf of actual shareholders that are contrary to their interests! Major problem with index/passive funds.
@BillyM2k Not a bad idea
@lexfridman True
@pmarca Humans
@Cernovich No kidding …
@SNICKERS Phew
@pmarca I’ve talked to many more people who were helped by psychedelics &amp; ketamine than SSRIs &amp; amphetamines
@pmarca Drugs, alcohol especially, have played a major role throughout history https://t.co/pV2UcLqCh8
@PPathole @pmarca A friend just emailed me about her bad Ritalin experience. Best to be cautious with all neurotransmitter drugs.
@PPathole @pmarca I have not heard bad things about Ritalin, which is not good to say it’s good, just haven’t heard bad things about it
@pmarca Wellbutrin is way worse than Adderall imo. It should be taken off the market. 

Every time that drug has come up in conversation, someone at the table has a suicide or near suicide story.
@WilliamShatner You will always be my Captain
@pmarca Adderall is an anger amplifier. Avoid at all costs.
@waitbutwhy Antarctica, which is a massive continent, only had a human settlement ~127 years ago

@TeslaOwnersEBay @GailAlfarATX @Tesla @EvaFoxU @Proxima06_Aiai @DBurkland @lewins_ian @Lstad78 @1stMarsColonist @JosephVVallace @dubbleotrippleo No, I meant wide release to high safety score beta participants. Going to all beta participants is expected later this year.
@teslaownersSV @28delayslater Update probably goes to wide release next week. This is a big one.
@28delayslater True haha
@WholeMarsBlog The people of Twitter strongly agree that Twitter needs to be fixed
But I’m no fan of the far right either. 

Let’s have less hate and more love.
The far left hates everyone, themselves included!
@TomFitton @Twitter This is messed up
@WholeMarsBlog I try not to pick fights, but I do finish them
@Cbiggs90 @Tesla @Teslarati @JaneidyEve The car knows that something is there, just doesn’t know that they’re horses yet, but it will. Dogs, cats and many other animals will also be recognized.
@waitbutwhy I strongly supported Obama for President, but today’s Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists
@WholeMarsBlog No further TSLA sales planned after today
“Real magic is only a sip away.”

@BillyM2k Same
@walterkirn Freedom of speech means freedom of speech
@scrowder Discomforting
@DavidSacks @willcain Accurate interview
@WatcherGuru FCC FTW!
@pmarca Sounds like satire
@DrRamblings @BillyM2k Great show!
@dogeofficialceo Trumpet is legit a way better name
Listen, I can’t do miracles ok https://t.co/z7dvLMUXy8
Let’s make Twitter maximum fun!
@PPathole Kicks Red Bull’s ass!
@BillyM2k Some sci-fi that actually features sci-fi would be great
Next I’m buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in
Twitter DMs should have end to end encryption like Signal, so no one can spy on or hack your messages
@dickc What are talking about? I’m just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.
For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally
@robbysoave @esaagar The Washington Post targets me relentlessly! 

Their insults could be higher quality, but some are not bad. I gave them 3 stars on Yelp.
@Erdayastronaut @RubinReport @nytimes @Forbes @SocialBlade Almost every media outlet on Earth wrote about me acquiring Twitter, causing a massive influx of new users
@RubinReport @nytimes @Forbes Yeah, I noticed that too. Pretty weird.
Should be called Trumpet instead!
Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech
Truth Social is currently beating Twitter &amp; TikTok on the Apple Store https://t.co/RxawVUAYKH
@Cernovich Sounds pretty bad …
@esaagar Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate
Raptor 2 rocket engines at Starbase, each producing over half a million pounds (230 tons) of force https://t.co/9ixxXXceG3
By “free speech”, I simply mean that which matches the law. 

I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. 

If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.

Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.
The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all
@dogeofficialceo Can someone please give the NPCs a bigger dialogue tree!?
I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means
And be my love in the rain
@TechEmails The Instagram curse: 

Water everywhere, yet always thirsty.
@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX @neuralink @boringcompany I do love humanity
@PPathole @WholeMarsBlog The San Francisco office of the SEC were shameless puppets of Wall St shortseller sharks, while doing nothing to protect actual shareholders. That is why I lost all respect for them.
@WholeMarsBlog The head of Saudi PIF committed unequivocally to take Tesla private with me, as witnessed by the Tesla CFO and several others. That is why I said funding was secured.
@JohnnaCrider1 @stats_feed Underground tunnels are immune to surface weather conditions (subways are a good example), so it wouldn’t matter to Hyperloop if a hurricane was raging on the surface. You wouldn’t even notice.
@JohnnaCrider1 @stats_feed In the coming years, Boring Co will attempt to build a working Hyperloop. 

From a known physics standpoint, this is the fastest possible way of getting from one city center to another for distances less than ~2000 miles. Starship is faster for longer journeys.
@WholeMarsBlog Next beta release has many improvements, especially for complex left turns &amp; heavy traffic
@SawyerMerritt Strange how these things are bucketed. I think of the whole company as being R&amp;D.
@BillyM2k First one definitely, second is nice to have and third isn’t needed imo
@TeslaJedi @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Drug naming conventions are so ridiculous! Does someone just literally have a random syllable generator!?
(from making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action)
@PPathole @JamesWLaw1 @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Getting there
@JamesWLaw1 @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Definitely. Might be less than 5 years away, as current version Neuralinks are semi-generalized neural read/write devices with ~1000 electrodes and tinnitus  probably needs &lt;&lt;1000.

Future gen Neuralinks will increase electrode count by many orders of magnitude.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge In the meantime, semaglutide (aka Ozempic/Rybelsus) appears to be effective in appetite control with minor side effects
@24_7TeslaNews @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Current generation Neuralinks can help to some degree, but an advanced case of Alzheimers often involves macro degeneration of the brain. 

However, Neuralinks should theoretically be able restore almost any functionality lost due *localized* brain damage from stroke or injury.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge If you’ve engineered or manufactured smart watches or phones, please join Neuralink! Your skills are directly applicable.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge It is an electronics/mechanical/software engineering problem for the Neuralink device that is similar in complexity level to smart watches (which are not easy!), plus the surgical robot, which is comparable to state-of-the art CNC machines.

No need for AI/ NN/ML quite yet.
Moving on …
@BillyM2k Also, epic printer scene in Office Space
@jack Your new title at Block is 🔥🔥
@PPathole Yeah
@wintonARK ESG ratings make no sense
@nichegamer Elden Ring is incredible, but why are extremely gory death/murder scenes ok, but panties get you banned!?
@BillyM2k 🤣 also why are there still printers?
@Teslarati Tesla China is doing incredible work
shadow ban council reviewing tweet … https://t.co/cawjtwc7CW
in case u need to lose a boner fast https://t.co/fcHiaXKCJi
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah, but I didn’t leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends. 

I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it’s not exactly top secret.
@WholeMarsBlog FSD is best in Bay Area, given engineering mostly lives there, but rest of country will soon be at that level
@PPathole @teslaownersSV @BillyM2k @engineers_feed Something like that
@AlexAndBooks_ Good list
@BillyM2k @engineers_feed So many “verified” scam crypto bots!
@engineers_feed I will verify you. 

The current process for verification is like if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!
@PPathole I wish we did. Would be better for making life multiplanetary.
What is best in life?
The Barbarians are at the Gate
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX The real tragedy is that tie I’m wearing!
@WholeMarsBlog That number should probably be on my gravestone at this point
Believe in the future
@APompliano Tesla is really a dozen or more startups if you look at all the things created from scratch that aren’t present in other car companies
And authenticate all real humans
@johnkrausphotos Indeed (heavy sigh)
If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!
Such a joy to work with amazingly talented people at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co!
@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Diess deserves a lot of credit for moving VW rapidly towards electrification. They’re lucky to have him.
@SamTwits My true moral error was creating Tesla &amp; SpaceX at same time, while avoiding general mgmt chores at Tesla (focusing only on product &amp; engineering). Tried to have my cake &amp; eat it too, which failed.
@SamTwits Agreed. I wish JB &amp; I had just moved forward to commercialize the Tzero without adding other partners. In the end, that’s what happened anyway.
@fermatslibrary Resistance is futile
@WholeMarsBlog The esthetics of the new rendering will improve
@TPostMillennial SNL is so rarely funny these day (sigh)
https://t.co/zYnkLgdDY8
@Erdayastronaut Making rocket reuse normal is the goal
@BillyM2k Always look on the bright side of life
@teslaownersSV @DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Maybe JB would be up for that too. He deserves a lot of credit (as do many longtime Tesla people).
@teslaownersSV @DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Ok sure
@garyblack00 The failures are mine, the successes belong to others
@DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty I should, but that would take a lot of time away from Tesla, SpaceX &amp; other work. Walter Isaacson is writing a book.
@PPathole @teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Exactly
@billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty I put in all I had, whereas Eberhard, who was worth over $10M at the time, refused to invest a penny to help Tesla. 

If it was really his baby, he would never have stood by while it starved to death.

https://t.co/ZDfYLD5qkL
@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty But if he was actually capable of creating a company like Tesla, he would have done so after he was fired for lying outrageously about cost &amp; progress of Roadster in mid 2007.

We would’ve lost at least a few talented people if he was the real deal, but we lost no one.
@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons), no one left with him. That says it all.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty If filing a shell corp constitutes “founding a company”, then I’d be the only founder of PayPal, since I filed the original incorporation docs for https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy (later renamed PayPal), but that’s not what founding means.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard. 

Even name “Tesla Motors” was owned by others!
Please consider working at The Boring Company! 

Our goal is to solve traffic, which plagues every major city on Earth.
@Erdayastronaut Hopefully, I didn’t say too many dumb things
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla opex is embarrassingly high imo!
@garyblack00 @MartinViecha $1T valuation with $0 advertising spend
@BillyM2k @nichegamer @slashdot Does it accurately portray software engineers?
@SawyerMerritt Yeah
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Had to been done
_______ is the Night
@nichegamer @slashdot Can they please just make sci-fi/fantasy at least *mostly* about sci-fi/fantasy?
@nichegamer @slashdot True
@akheriaty I love Pinball Wizard!
https://t.co/h3psi9XFlT
@PPathole Absolutely
@slashdot The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable
A social media platform’s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy
@pmarca Extremely concerning. Who is pushing this censorship/deplatforming? Very shadowy.
SpaceX Falcon team making great progress! Aiming for 5 day launch cadence with many performance &amp; refurb improvements.
Why, thank you, sir!  https://t.co/tealJWLSdP
@garyblack00 Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there
@ICannot_Enough @jaylew333 Since he is consistently wrong, it should be possible to do quite well simply by doing the opposite of what he recommends
@TrungTPhan @TEDchris I feel it’s important that one’s hat also have a hat. Long-standing belief.
@teslaownersSV @Tesla I used to be such a snappy dresser!
@Erdayastronaut I think my clothes are too big for me
@itsALLrisky @gigadgets_ I love it, sign me up
@gigadgets_ Sounds high
@TEDchris I should probably stop cutting my own hair haha
@TEDchris Good interview
Happy Easter! https://t.co/3gBFlrPOQO
Smooth landing video
@WholeMarsBlog Based on feedback received, we will drop mobile connector price to $200 &amp; make it easy to order with car. 

Note, mobile connector is not needed if you have a Tesla wall connector or to use Superchargers.

Recommend installing Tesla wall connector well before car arrives.
@WSBChairman In fairness to the Twitter board, this might be more of a concern about other potential bidders vs just me
@WholeMarsBlog Usage statistics were super low, so seemed wasteful. On the (minor) plus side, we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit.
🎶 Love Me Tender 🎶
@ChrisJBakke Wow, with Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares! Objectively, their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders.
@waitbutwhy Civilization, as defined by the invention of writing, is only ~5500 years old https://t.co/SMHYvKN2sd
@DavidSacks Indeed
@lrocket @TonyeFreeman Thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines!
@yishan My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is *way* overdue for long form tweets!
@BillyM2k As I was saying …
@vladtenev 6 seconds, better said as 6000 milliseconds, which is a long time to computers, is about right
@cameron If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty. 

The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale.
@Cernovich Good question
Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board
@PoliticalShort @Twitter Absolutely. It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company, not the board of directors.
@Alwaleed_Talal @Twitter @Kingdom_KHC Interesting. Just two questions, if I may. 

How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly &amp; indirectly?

What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?
Will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law
I made an offer 
https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu
@JeffBezos Great idea
@BLKMDL3 Coming soon
@tesla_raj Exciting times ahead
@pmarca Disconnected from what it takes to make stuff
@teslaownersSV I’m serious about this one btw
@sweatystartup Exactly
@PPathole Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front &amp; account doesn’t get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) &amp; suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam
@PPathole It should go away or scammers will game the system by signing up only for a few months
@GonzaAbalos Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?
@GonzaAbalos Yes, should be proportionate to affordability &amp; in local currency
@BLKMDL3 Exactly. It would massively expand the verified pool &amp; make bot armies too expensive to maintain.
@michaeljburry You will get it back, even though you shorted Tesla, you bastard 🤣
Weather is fake. I seen Truman Show!
@teslaownersSV The resemblance is uncanny https://t.co/egFdUWso7Q
@LPofMN As the saying goes, when the government first prints money, everyone feels like a winner, but in the end no one does
@siddarthpaim Fake news purveyors would have hysterics, but a ratings system would improve quality of news greatly
@universal_sci All of Earth is a tiny dust mote compared to the Sun
69.420% of statistics are false
Truth is the first casualty. https://t.co/cN9PIfDvjr
@Jason @justinbieber Yeah
@WholeMarsBlog @jspeedymorris22 @darrenrovell Absolutely
@jspeedymorris22 @darrenrovell Now subtract crypto scam accounts that twitter constantly shows as “real” people in everyone’s feed
And @justinbieber only posted once this entire year
For example, @taylorswift13 hasn’t posted anything in 3 months
Most of these “top” accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. 

Is Twitter dying?
Interesting
@PPathole @stats_feed We have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction &amp; refinement
@PPathole @stats_feed True
@stats_feed Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining &amp; refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.

There is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction/refinement is slow.
@EvaFoxU @vincent13031925 Team did amazing work!

@remedygames Great games
@StockMKTNewz No sale took place. Initial share number filed was incorrect.
@RealWheelieman @WholeMarsBlog Increasingly likely that the Tesla vehicle computer will be able to process 288 FPS (36 Hz * 8 cameras)
@RealWheelieman @WholeMarsBlog 10.12 will significantly improve unprotected left turns
@Rainmaker1973 The power used by humans is so tiny compared to how much power from the Sun reaches Earth!

Solar power is ~1GW per sq km. At current solar efficiency, net electrical power is ~200 MW per square km.

The entire United States can be powered by a small corner of Texas.
@pmarca @skepticaliblog Yikes
@pmarca WaPo always good for a laugh 🤣🤣
@jack Thanks Jack!
@paraga Looking forward to working with Parag &amp; Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Yeah, single most annoying problem on twitter imo
@Erdayastronaut That sounds reasonable
@boztank @Liz_Wheeler Facebook gives me the willies
@OstynHyss @stevenmarkryan That is harder than a boss battle in DS3!
@stevenmarkryan I mean, if the people vote overwhelmingly for something, it is at least *a* data point!
Do you want an edit button?
@hausman_k @GoogleAI Staggeringly unfunny
@WholeMarsBlog First I’ve learned of this. Will be patched shortly.
@slashdot Spain should build a massive solar array. Could power all of Europe.
Oh hi lol
Berlin rocks
@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Raptor pump power is over 100MW per engine &amp; 33 engines, means over 3GW. Not even remotely possible for electric motors &amp; batteries to compete.
@GerberKawasaki We aim for 30% GM or ~10% profitability, all costs included
@PopMech Good summary
@JuicyCreativ3 George Lucas once told me that the only reason Star Wars got made is because the old studio heads died
@JuicyCreativ3 Old people don’t change their minds, with rare exception, they just die. Without death, there would not be change.
I am inspired by curiosity. 

That is what drives me. 

So let us expand the scope &amp; scale of consciousness so that we may aspire to understand the Universe.
@WholeMarsBlog There will come a time in the future where people will be surprised that we let practically anyone drive a 2 ton death machine anywhere they want
Peace. Peace?  I hate the word. Those who do care about peace (myself aspirationally included) don’t need to hear it. And those who don’t care about peace? Well …
@Kristennetten @PPathole @engineers_feed I look kinda dumb in that pic haha

@cleantechnica Worth noting that, as of Jan 1, Tesla buyers no longer received any federal tax credit. Model 3 led despite this disadvantage.

@jimkwik @jadescipioni No problem
@PPathole @TheOnion Cute as a button
@TheOnion Fallout New Omaha
@jadescipioni @jimkwik His ideas sound sensible, but he was not my or SpaceX’s “brain coach”. I think he maybe gave a talk once.
@JonErlichman 5 years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by &gt;1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars.
@Erdayastronaut @NASA @SpaceX Mars needs to happen soon
Made on Earth by humans
@cbs_spacenews @NASASpaceflight Cool
@RyanMaue @flcnhvy @jayleno Pretty much
@flcnhvy @jayleno Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even 3% smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. We’ll probably do a smaller, tight world truck at some point.
@flcnhvy Haha true! Hard to convey tone in tweets. Many people would probably be a lot less upset if they heard me speak the words.

The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval. It that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.

@DavidMainayar Napoleon was incredible. “It is my wish that my ashes may repose on the banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French people, whom I have loved so well.”
The Age of Napoleon by Will &amp; Ariel Durant is an amazing book
@akidesir @DanielleFong @ThieveryCorpDC A few weeks away
@DanielleFong @ThieveryCorpDC Totally. Collective mind control by stoking fear.
@jonnajarian Yes, improvement is exponential
@Jennerator211 Yeah. Maybe following individual journalists &amp; citizen journalists is better than publications. The Onion may be the best mainstream media source. Hard to figure out what’s actually going on in the world!
It’s remarkable how often The News attempts to answer the question: what is the worst thing that happened on Earth today?
@crystaloftruth @Newsweek Still am
@crystaloftruth @Newsweek More or less crazy than reality itself?
@lavvphotography @Newsweek It’s next-level for sure. Reality is getting weird fast.
@Oh_Gee_Man Famous last words
@Newsweek I said run for office, not president (sigh). Who even owns Newsweek these days? I lost track.
@Teslarati Boring Co will also connect Vegas hotels &amp; airport. Autonomous Teslas in tunnels will provide individualized mass transit.
@flcnhvy We’re going to have to push out the date or attendance will be very low. Maybe do in two parts: webcast next month &amp; in-person event a few months later?

@AdamDavidHalsey @devonwerkharder Seriously, Big Candy is suppressing R&amp;D! When’s the last time you heard of a great new candy bar?
@franksdcaudill He was critical of large bureaucracies &amp; Napoleon III was indeed a knucklehead
@ylecun @an_open_mind @jjvincent Fair point, PyTorch is great!
@devonwerkharder Capitalism already has many fetters in the form of a plethora of regulatory bodies! I’m definitely against any monopolies/oligopolies where there is a low forcing function for improving customer happiness or an unpriced externality that consumes a common good (eg emissions).
@Tallest0ne Probably sooner
@ReidarSundy @TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente This is happening a lot
@MMelinot That would be cool!
@vistacruiser7 @flcnhvy Very much agree!
@nichegamer 🤣🤣 Along with several guillotine death threats!

In his 18th Brumaire essay (in which he does make some good points), Marx famously said history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. This is now ironically happening with Marxism.
@CodingMark @ResistMonsters @TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente Exactly
@flcnhvy Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level.
@flcnhvy SpaceX has 8000 employees in California, Washington, Texas &amp; Florida. Operating this entire time, as we have national security exemption. Zero deaths or serious illnesses.
@flcnhvy Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.
@TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente The statistics stopped being valid when anyone with “covid symptoms”, which is now almost anything, was counted as having covid
@stoolpresidente Well said! Please run for office. The politicians &amp; unelected bureaucrats who stole our liberty should be tarred, feathered &amp; thrown out of town!

@Crusade4change @realDonaldTrump Those who always disagree have a closed mind … but, by their very nature, that won’t sink in (sigh)
@thirdrowtesla It’s not often that the Governor of California &amp; the President agree!
@AlexBerenson It appears that what he is saying is untrue
@archillect Lil baby
@WolvesSuperfan Great
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa Wow, great writing!
@KenJennings All other car companies are allowed to manufacture *except* Tesla, you knucklehead. No wonder you got crushed by a computer the size of a pizza box.
@teslaownersSV Much appreciated!
That’s pretty much what happened https://t.co/5Enzgt20q7
@Alex_ADEdge @NASASpaceflight Pretty close. It will look absurdly tall &amp; have a lot more ground support equipment.
@alandail Haggerty actually admitted to NYT that he told his staff to “slow down” Tesla for reasons that had nothing to do with health. Unreal …
@flcnhvy @thehill @GavinNewsom Exactly
@thehill Don’t mislead the public. State said YES, an unelected county official is the problem. Tesla factory in adjacent San Joaquin county is fully operational.
Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.
@ChillMichelle @Tesla Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up!

@Tpear10 @LegendaryEnergy Sheriff Bianco rocks!
@UniverCurious They were amazing
@TeslaTested @LegendaryEnergy Absolutely. Moreover, they don’t even need to be tested for covid, just need “covid-like symptoms”, which is a long list, including “feeling weakness”. Hard to die *without* feeling weakness!

@thirdrowtesla @Tesla @AlamedaCounty @ACSOSheriffs @Dare2BWell I’m not messing around. Absurd &amp; medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by *unelected* county officials with no accountability, needs to stop.
@adrianfine @Tesla @cityofpaloalto Much appreciated, Mayor Fine!
@teslaownersSV @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla @AlamedaCounty Thanks Mayor Mei! https://t.co/YFJSGd3Emp
@vincent13031925 @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely
@teslaownersSV @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with @AlamedaCounty
@TeslaOwnersEBay @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Yes, already done
@bradd_libby Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter
@KristiRJensen @EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
@EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.
@SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.
@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.
@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!
@mattduplessis No, I have a license!

@thesheetztweetz @SpaceX @USCG @PortCanaveral Glad we could help
@JoshManuel It’s true
@Erdayastronaut @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Coming soon
@thirdrowtesla @Erdayastronaut @mayemusk Yes, this is a high priority
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
@OfficialAPoD @joerogan Pain can certainly be turned off, but we’re not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
@IvanEscobosa @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
@sspencer_smb @flcnhvy It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
@flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.
@raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.
@clairlemon @Quillette A mandatory tracing app would be insane
@AndrewFosterWa1 @KillaSarg @Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight True
@teslaownersSV @vincent13031925 @joerogan Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
@vincent13031925 @joerogan Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 🤣🤣
@Godmiller1 @Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Would cover latitude of London
@TesLatino Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms.
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Sure :)
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Way more important than it sounds
@GavinNewsom Yeah!!
@Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
@Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight SLS makes me feel sad
@WhatsupFranks @NASASpaceflight No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
@ABauerle5 A great mystery of the universe
@NASASpaceflight It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.
@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid
@Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! https://t.co/WF9AGgee12
@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we’ll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack.
@thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Turns on city street intersections is the big one
@YoavOffek Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
@geekwire Not SpaceX
@thirdrowtesla His son sounds great btw
@PPathole @InSpaceXItrust @Space_Station @Tesla @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew 2008 was a super tough year on all levels
@thirdrowtesla Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That’s why.
@PicklePunchD @BBCScienceNews Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.
@InSpaceXItrust @Space_Station @Tesla @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew That was the whole company back then. Grew organically from a simple mariachi party in El Segundo.

@WhatsupFranks @alexmd2 @slashdot @NYGovCuomo That would be awesome
@subeiwoo @JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson This is false. JD’s team put out “video evidence”, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated.
@teslaownersSV @slashdot Yeah, definitely a future feature
@martinvars @GavinNewsom Levitt rocks
@slashdot Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms.
@AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake “science”.
@AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson What a tool

@cleantechnica Anyway, we’re just talking about 2% here, so not much. Confident Model S will get 400+ miles as soon as retest is allowed.
@cleantechnica Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace I hope anything lands
@NASASpaceflight @TesLatino @Erdayastronaut It seems unlikely right now
@TesLatino @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.

@Rustybret Online
Well said, Lord Sumption, well said!
@thirdrowtesla Ok, we will
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Kristennetten Yes, about a month away from testing Raptor Vacuum
@Kristennetten A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton.
Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
Minecraft has amazing legs
That was 2.5 years ago &amp; still not even on the moon. Progress must accelerate!

@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yes, switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes.
@kulpability @NASASpaceflight Successive iteration of both design &amp; manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
@NASASpaceflight It’s a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!

@CBSNewYork @AielloTV Heard same from doc I trust
@yourfavgas @justpaulinelol No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad
@justpaulinelol That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
So often true 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qxmDtZ4Buf
@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
@PPathole Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
@jh_csquared @AlexBrendel2 @Erdayastronaut As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard
@PPathole Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
@jgrano305 @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Progress is good
@thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Definitely
@cleantechnica Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation.
@DMC_Ryan @RenataKonkoly Sure, we can probably do an update later this year
@Kristennetten @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Needs to be more than halfway to east coast

@WhatsupFranks Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities &amp; mortality proportionate to age.
Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted &amp; herd immunity much higher. Good news.
@ajtourville @psidart @TOGregTO Maybe Cybertruck will have it …
@psidart @TOGregTO I’m dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA &amp; water distillation. It’s weird, but I really want to do it.
@westcoastbill Good one
@jgrano305 @teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
@teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing.
@TOGregTO That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil &amp; gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy.
@TheOnion So shall we all
@Erdayastronaut Haha sure
@Teslarati Good summary
@MFrunker @teslaownersSV @CodingMark @JosephVVallace @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Coming soon
@CodingMark @JosephVVallace @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Yeah, it’s named after my friend Joe who suggested the feature
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Maybe just make Joe Mode quieter?
@flcnhvy Private beta begins in ~3 months, public beta in ~6 months, starting with high latitudes
In advance of this, please try to hack Starlink &amp; Tesla Mothership!
There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites 🛰 😉
@PPathole @Supernova_Style New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan https://t.co/yYrjwWwixl
@skorusARK Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothing’s as weird as reality!
@TesLatino @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker @SpaceX It’s made of a special dark foam that’s extremely radio transparent, so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now.
@yourfavgas @julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg &amp; ignited in flight
@julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Sure hope so!
@TOGregTO Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so
@TOGregTO Not the greatest use of money
@anime_virus @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites …
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Makes sense
@nichegamer Nice
@jgrano305 @PPathole @Supernova_Style Anything surprising?
@PPathole @Supernova_Style Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
@Supernova_Style No kidding …
@ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Good article
@PPathole @AnnieW Am in Boca working on the rocket with an awesome team, so pretty great :)
@brendan2908 @cleantechnica Definitely header tanks &amp; nosecone on SN5, hopefully flaps too. Definitely flaps on SN6
@cleantechnica Crazy times!
@archillect Red sky of Mars is

@PPathole @morgan_murphy Check the warranty …
@Teslarati Thanks everyone! Still can’t believe I was born 69 days after 4/20 🤓
@batflyer @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Yes. It will even float for a while.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Yeah, and whole lot more! Aargh, I’m dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday!!
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Thinking about this …
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla This is the key paragraph https://t.co/zvTWhPVcM4
@alvianchoiri @Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Pretty much
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Mechanically attached to steel studs. Insulation is certainly the intention!
Best political platform ever https://t.co/CRbNFdQj4B
@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @NASA SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing &amp; now docking with @Space_Station, which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves &amp; will be uncrewed at first.
@RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Great platform 🤣🤣
@teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars
@Peter_J_Beck @thesheetztweetz @ulalaunch @torybruno @SpaceX 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
@Erdayastronaut I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind.
@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter.
@InSpaceXItrust @jgrano305 Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
@jgrano305 Probably 3 to 6 months
@flcnhvy Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points https://t.co/5cPQ29wOvu
@flcnhvy You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.
https://t.co/wHkAQ9177V
@PPathole @nichegamer My kids loved that one when they were little
@SpaceForceDoD @AF_Academy Congratulations again! Starfleet begins …
@marcelzimmer @parth_dhawale @Tesla The way it should be!
@AF_Academy You’re welcome! Very exciting times ahead for space.
@bluemoondance74 @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
@MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry
@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Similar, but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects
@jgrano305 @AusTeslaOwners Should be available as an in app purchase next month
@AusTeslaOwners You’re right, will fix
@TeslaGong @vincent13031925 @flcnhvy Good point. Yeah, Remdesivir is sounding very promising!
Orbital human spaceflight returns to the Cape in six weeks!
@vincent13031925 @flcnhvy Advertising salespeople dressed as truth tellers
@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Trying have fewer parts, so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic &amp; subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying.
@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Flaps, actuator &amp; static aero are undergoing redesign for mass reduction &amp; simplicity
@CovelloMassimo @Tesla Will do
@flcnhvy True
@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Exactly
Good progress, but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime. https://t.co/IsICexqxtV
@Teslarati Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.
@AngelNDevil2 @S_Padival @fourthrowtesla @TESLAcharts It’s a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but it’s the future we should have
@Kristennetten @TeslaGong @mattkalin @kimbal Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week. Should have number then.
@jgrano305 @TeslaGong @mattkalin @kimbal Reduced size by ~3%, center line is more level &amp; lower window sill height
@TeslaGong @mattkalin @kimbal All new
@neiltyson It is about 10% too small, but lots of fun 😀
@mattkalin @kimbal We’re working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.
@kimbal Karma is real
@westcoastbill Yeah, super messed up
These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment
Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators https://t.co/sfI6yuUbrM
@mdornic @CNN Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
@engineers_feed Nice
@NatureNews Interesting
@ADMofLibertalia So true
@CNN @GavinNewsom Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help! https://t.co/UlBmRGPtuc
@Amro_Alzeiq @CNN @GavinNewsom I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 🤣🤣
@CNN .@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding
@alandail @paulasaywhatnow @CNN Exactly
@CNN What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
@flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
@dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
@TJShannon87 @Bob_Wachter I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington
@annerajb @samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
@Bob_Wachter They were, but are they currently?
@samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter Interesting
@Bob_Wachter We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.
@RationalEtienne @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
@Erdayastronaut @BnOrdhaug @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Sure
@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.
@KeithMansfield @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck That’s for sure! 😅
@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
@PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla My (again) personal favorite is https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
@sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
@fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.
https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
@cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!
@PPathole @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
@Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg
@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.
@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
@thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.
@SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.
To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
@brandonbernicky You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
@justpaulinelol There’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!
Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature
@thirdrowtesla This will happen
@PPathole @thirdrowtesla We stole that from cheetahs
@thirdrowtesla In case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs
@Sofiaan @thirdrowtesla There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A.

@thirdrowtesla Yes, this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt.
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize
@katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace @Rogozin In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.
@Darkellysio @katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: https://t.co/Aq81q9oMdq
@katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.
@cleantechnica A lot has happened in 8 years
@AbiyAhmedAli @Tesla Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
@SciGuySpace SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.

@JsEquinox Essentially
@master_ov @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Good one
What is simple in one arena is often profound in another
Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware
@ajtourville @thirdrowtesla Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. That’s a trillion calculations between each output command.
@thirdrowtesla Humans drive using 2 cameras on a slow gimbal &amp; are often distracted. A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar &amp; always being alert can definitely be superhuman.

@LMSpace @SpaceX You’re most welcome
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah, we just need to confirm there are no safety regressions
@WholeMarsBlog 12.4.2 is much smoother. Challenge is keeping safety high, while increasing ride comfort. 

Build moves to internal testing tomorrow.

@JTLonsdale @JeffBezos In past years, Blue Origin also sued to stop SpaceX from using what is now our primary launchpad at 39A and tried to patent landing a rocket on a ship, even though that idea had been around for 70 years!

Another “conspiracy theory” turns out to be true. 

Strange that Arizona requires proof of citizenship for state, but not federal elections 🤔
@Erdayastronaut @Teslaconomics @SpaceX We could build a lot more, but the next version of Raptor is really the one to scale up production. We begin testing it in McGregor within a week or so. 

Regenerative cooling and secondary flow paths have been made integral to the whole engine, thus no heat shield is required.

@WholeMarsBlog Then HW5, which has been renamed to AI5, in the second half of next year. 

The Tesla AI5 computer has ~10X the capability of HW4 computer and Tesla makes the whole software stack.

@PezRadar Please fix the Druid class. After this patch, Druid went from doing 3% of Barb/Sorc damage to 1%!!

https://t.co/HGCYdZWG2s
Tesla Megapacks massively increase electric power generation efficiency, as they can buffer power at night for use in the day, dramatically reducing the need to build new powerplants. 

It also allows for the least efficient power plants to be shut down!
The new Model 3 Long Range is an amazing car
@ZFellows_ True
@AdrianDittmann Yeah
Big improvements to advertising
@PezRadar Druid damage is 30 times lower than Barb or Sorc. Would be great to address this.
@Teslaconomics @WholeMarsBlog Rolls out to select areas in a few months. 

Also, Mini can be a great low-cost option for a good backup Internet connection if your landline goes out.

Starship is the most power flying object ever created. 

Currently over twice the thrust of Saturn V and, with future upgrades, three times the thrust (10,000 tons of force).
@cb_doge Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t think we should trust him with user data 🤷‍♂️

A permanently crewed Moon base is possible.
@cb_doge Great question
@Mekuna2897 Impressive build optimization! 

Sadly, there is no hope for Druid.
@RepThomasMassie I agree. He (and others) should be in jail for impugning the integrity of the United States by taking bribes for political favors, but not for this pseudo-crime.
@0xgaut I do have to applaud Apple for their bravery in removing legacy ports

@ByeonChansoo @markusdd5 I like the fighter-mage combo of Druid in Diablo, as it has the most complexity. 

Which class is strongest varies by Diablo season and is often due to bugs in the battle mechanics. 

Blizzard both nerfed the Druid main attack *and* fixed a bugs that led to the class dominating
@markusdd5 We did clear the highest level of any party that is majority Druid (weakest class) in the world on this stream and there are ~10M current Diablo players, but nobody noticed 😢

Now imagine if an AI trained in this way grows in power immensely
@MKBHD Apple using the words “protect your privacy” while handing your data over to a third-party AI that they don’t understand and can’t themselves create is *not* protecting privacy at all!
@pronounced_kyle True
It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security &amp; privacy!

Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river.
@tim_cook Don’t want it. 

Either stop this creepy spyware or all Apple devices will be banned from the premises of my companies.
And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage
If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation.

@wintonARK Far too much of the stock market is effectively controlled by ISS and Glass Lewis, who have zero economic alignment with actual shareholders!
@zerohedge Yeah, this is not cool. 

If they actually surveyed their constituents, they would discover overwhelming support in favor. 

So far, roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor of both resolutions. The public sentiment is unequivocally supportive.
I’ve mentioned something like this before, but, if any of my companies goes public, we will prioritize other longtime shareholders of my other companies, including Tesla.

@DJSnM Cool, but it’s better to use a rocket booster. Planes just can’t compete when it comes to orbital Spaceflight.
@ICannot_Enough Thanks for mentioning this

@___frye Engineering is fun for me, whereas politics and posting on controversial issues feels like putting my hand on a hot stove – mega pain. 

The reason I do the latter, admittedly ineptly at times, is because I think it is necessary to counteract corrosion of civilization.

Ship it https://t.co/Kj5OTpmmK5
@yacineMTB Next flight, we try to catch it with giant Mechzilla arms, inspired, at least in part, inspired by Kong v Godzilla. 

If they can fake do it in movies, we can do it irl! Logic.
@VivekGRamaswamy Very concerning
@seeMOUSErun @SpaceX Full and immediate reusability of an orbital rocket is the fundamental break through needed to become a multi planet species and a true spacefaring civilization

@alex_avoigt Thanks Cathie
@Kristennetten We plan to move older Starships close to the fence, so people can take pics with them if they want
@Rainmaker1973 Not bad. They should clean up the details in the wedges. Looks messy in there.
@Devon_Eriksen_ Government helps, but technology advances primarily via technology entrepreneurs
@RW_UNP Much appreciated
@astro_greek Yeah
@stclairashley Yeah

Another Falcon 9 launch! 

Falcon alone is trending to set a world record for the most amount of mass Earth delivers to orbit in a year.
Congratulations @narendramodi on your victory in the world’s largest democratic elections! Looking forward to my companies doing exciting work in India.

@SawyerMerritt @UpfitTesla @UnpluggedTesla Cool
@stevenmarkryan Chanos is shady
Worth mentioning that switching to ultra hard, cold-rolled stainless steel for Starship is what led me to make Cybertruck out of it too
@InfographicTony @SpaceX Pretty accurate
If you want a detailed explanation of why I switched Starship from carbon fiber to stainless steel 
 https://t.co/pXC0ngheiw
@WholeMarsBlog Looking into it
@DavidSacks Thoughtful
Note, a newer version of Starship has the forward flaps shifted leeward. This will help improve reliability, ease of manufacturing and payload to orbit.
Not a difficult prediction! We will have this nailed for next flight.

@MikeBenzCyber Great idea
@CathieDWood Exactly
Thanks Cathie
@marenkahnert Yes. 

I should note that we have since moved to a proprietary stainless steel alloy, developed internally, as 301 in plate form had interlaminar toughness issues at cryogenic temperatures.
@matteosalvinimi Thanks!
Today was a great day for humanity’s future as a spacefaring civilization!

Nothing unites us more than working together towards inspiring objectives.
@growing_daniel Fair point!
@GiorgiaMeloni Thanks!
@JohnStossel ESG ratings are extremely distorted
@SawyerMerritt Cool
@RobertKennedyJr @TuckerCarlson Sachs is right
Accurate 😂
We did switch to a passive (mostly) glass heat shield, rather than actively-cooled steel, as the latter was heavier, at least according to initial calculations
Why is Starship made of stainless steel? This article from 5 years ago explains the reasons.

Worth noting that the ship would have failed on reentry if made of aluminum or carbon fiber, as they can’t take the heat.

https://t.co/QVAtv74quq
🚀🚀 Stainless Steel Rocket 🚀🚀
@krassenstein Speaks to the incredible resilience of stainless steel at temperature. 

We will further hone our SX300 alloy to withstand even higher temperatures.
@Cmdr_Hadfield @SpaceX Thanks Chris!

A fully and immediately reusable orbital heat shield, which (as you know) has never been made before, is the single toughest problem remaining.

Being able to iterate with many ideas on many ships is key to solving this.
@jack attention is all you need
@Kristennetten @SpaceX I think we should try to catch the booster with the mechazilla arms next flight!
@cb_doge Yeah
Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!

Congratulations @SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!
Successful soft landing of the Starship Super Heavy rocket booster!

There are a massive number of changes to this build. It should arguably be called v13, but we’re sticking to 12 😂 

Two other
@Rob_2628 Nice.

Also, your feedback for improvement is spot-on.
Congratulations on a successful launch!

@ajtourville The existing factory space was already allocated to vehicle, battery and cell production. 

And this is not a matter of tucking a few computers into a corner. You need a kW of power and cooling for each GPU, which would mean 12MW of power and 12MW of cooling.

Also, I can’t overstate the difficulty of making 50k H100s train as a coherent system. No company on Earth has been able to achieve this yet. 

Once we have that system working, we will order more hardware.
@WholeMarsBlog @rocker_261 @SawyerMerritt Training compute for Tesla is relatively small compared to inference compute, as the latter scales linearly with size of fleet. 

Perhaps the best way to think about it is in terms of power consumption. 

When the Tesla fleet reaches 100M vehicles, peak power consumption of AI
@SawyerMerritt Of the roughly $10B in AI-related expenditures I said Tesla would make this year, about half is internal, primarily the Tesla-designed AI inference computer and sensors present in all of our cars, plus Dojo. 

For building the AI training superclusters, NVidia hardware is about
@cb_doge Yeah
@tim_zaman True
@WallStreetSilv WaPo lost tremendous credibility over the past several years by being a far left propaganda publication

@BillMelugin_ I’m in favor of greatly increasing our legal immigration, but hardcore stopping illegal immigration. 

This guy will probably will actually work hard, but there should be a probationary period where working hard and good behavior are required to stay in America.

@greg_price11 True
@MarioNawfal Ukraine will most likely decline, because NATO won’t let them stop the war yet.

That allows Putin to tell the Russian people that he offered peace and it was refused, so there is no choice but to ramp up the war.
@cb_doge Rest in peace
@libsoftiktok @ChrisWardCA That is absolute showstopper for me regarding California.
@MarioNawfal Yeah

@Not_the_Bee Is this actually possible?

@lexfridman Yeah. Caffeine doesn’t affect me much, but I like the ceremony of it.
@America1stLegal Interesting
@JulienSalinasEN @grok Cool
@xDaily True 😂
@Rob_2628 Wow. Druid is so weak by comparison :(
A lot of social media is bad for kids, as there is extreme competition between social media AIs to maximize dopamine!

Congratulations to the @SpaceX team on passing 3 million customers in 99 countries!

And thanks to you for buying @Starlink!
SpaceX might exceed 90% of all Earth payload to orbit later this year. 

Once Starship is launching at high rate, probably &gt;99%. Has to be or we can’t build a city on Mars or base on moon.

We file almost no patents, so nothing stopping competition from copying us.

@PeterSweden7 Support the farmers!

@RobertKennedyJr @thehill @CNN You should be in the debate
@PeterSweden7 For a country at high latitude, like Sweden, fission makes more sense than (indirect) fusion (aka solar). 

Solar starts to make sense below 60 degrees latitude and is compelling around ~53 from the equator.

@PeterSweden7 Wind turbines are fine if out of the way where they aren’t an eyesore. They are competitive when paired with batteries.

Nuclear fission is a no-brainer. We should have a lot more of it.

Worth noting that no one has ever succeeded in creating a fully reusable heat shield. Shuttle required &gt;6 months of rework.
@MattWalshShow Nonstop race-baiting!
@alx Maybe he hates eggplant 🍆
@SethDillon They start with that conclusion as 💯 likely and just fill in the reasoning afterwards

@AlexFinnX Yes, this will significantly increase the reach of smaller accounts
@stillgray They didn’t get the memo
@netcapgirl Yeah!
@cb_doge Well, to be fair, the legacy media sometimes attack other “billionaires” 😂

But, yeah, it is weird. Maybe I just get a lot of clicks? 

The legacy media is a click-maximizing machine, rather than a truth-maximizing machine.

@BasedBeffJezos That said, a desirable outcome is not certain

As for brushing up, I have tried to read about every significant battle in history, as well as every book on strategy or tactics since I was a child.
@shaunmmaguire Future wars will be drone wars. 

Any given battle roughly comes down to kill ratio times number of units, assuming both sides have roughly similar unit counts.

This means that winning on kill ratio is irrelevant if the opponent has a much larger unit production advantage. This

@AdrianoinJapan @PolarStarRose He does like to play with my phone. There are many confusing videos he has taken.
@PolarStarRose Sorry, accidental tap!
@JeffTutorials @WholeMarsBlog That’s arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.

As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.

As for the cost of reviewing apps for security, a fixed fee makes sense.
@WholeMarsBlog Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple &amp; Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, it’s basically a monopoly. 

The effective 30% sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry.
@RenataKonkoly @WholeMarsBlog Top feature request for sure
@WholeMarsBlog Actually, I like &amp; use Apple products. 

They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. 

Epic wouldn’t bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair.
Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.
@JamesClayton5 @markgurman @tim_cook Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. 

There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever.

@skorusARK Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk.

@Gfilche Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. 

I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft.

@rich_teer @Tesla We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place.

@WholeMarsBlog Computers are absurdly more accurate than humans. 

How long would it take for a human to render even one frame of a modern video game at low res? The computer will do high res at 120 frames per second. Not a contest.

@OwenSparks_ @LabPadre Austin now, but back at Starbase tomorrow
@Teslarati @KlenderJoey Norway has played a major role in supporting advent of electric vehicles!
@LabPadre Seriously, we’re getting eaten alive. Can’t get to Mars if the bugs eat us first.
@AaronJoelGeorge @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Length will grow by ~500 ft over time
@AaronJoelGeorge @Teslarati @KlenderJoey The building is ~7 stores tall, so each “floor” is double size. Hard to appreciate unless you’re close.
@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I was at Giga Texas yesterday. Team is making excellent progress. Building will be almost a mile long when complete.
@NASASpaceflight Construction starts soon on a much larger high bay just north of current high bay
@BLKMDL3 @arctechinc @Tesla Several improvements coming via V9.1 on Friday at midnight
@ValaAfshar @Tesla Tesla Giga Shanghai team has done amazing work!

@EvaFoxU That was me after Cyberpunk Razor fight haha
Being thanked by game NPCs brought me real joy tbh https://t.co/43Dkfyhhfu
@WhatsupFranks @Teslarati The comments on this article are funny
@Teslarati Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge.

Even so, fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars. There are over 200,000 combustion engine car fires every year in US alone. It’s literally in the name.

https://t.co/uJPlB3IbzQ
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure
@Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport.
@PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!

Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.

Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done.
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal More of a pathfinder test. Actual payload bay door dimensions are still under debate. Volume is ~1000 cubic meters. Roomy …
@AustinTeslaClub @cleantechnica That’s the goal!
@WholeMarsBlog @karpathy The feeling is mutual. But I can’t emphasize enough that we work with an amazing team. The credit is theirs.
@flcnhvy @HassanAesthetic @pcgamer Maybe I will. It’s on PC now.
@HassanAesthetic @pcgamer I couldn’t do WoW. Awesome, but too much time required.
@pcgamer Great game
@TeslaGong @madan3 If Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely.
@newscientist Very impressive! @DeepMind
@madan3 But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles. That would be much appreciated.
@SamTwits @MKBHD Tesla Model S Plaid is alien technology
@MKBHD Also, the full self-driving interface renders across the whole display &amp; it is incredible. The yoke enables an unobstructed view of the screen.
@MKBHD Good review &amp; fair critique. 

In general with interfaces, all input is error. With each software update, the car’s intuition will get better. You will need to press buttons less &amp; less &amp; it will know when to ignore accidental button presses.
@DrPhiltill Minimizing $/ton to the surface of Mars is the fundamental optimization
@WholeMarsBlog This will become very important over time
@AlexSvanArt @Neopork85 Flight tests showed that we could make body flaps narrower &amp; lighter
@AustinTeslaClub @RoschetzkyP @Tesla @TeslaNY @TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaForThe_Win @jchybow @1stMarsColonist @EvaFoxU @heydave7 @gailalfa1 Also lasts much longer than normal roofs &amp; is able to withstand hail &amp; other medium-sized impacts
@therationalroot Seriously, negative nominal interest rates!? What is the world coming to …
@DELTA_V But, much more important, is that this *design* is capable of full &amp; rapid reusability. 

Long way to go from design to making it actually fully &amp; rapidly reusable with high payload, but at least success is *one* of the possible outcomes haha.
@Model3Owners Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries. 

That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwell’s proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; we’re still not quite done.
@Model3Owners Ironic indeed, as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles. 

But lithium-ion has it covered. Even with no advances in lithium-ion technology, it’s possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy.
@SciGuySpace Nice
@AaronS5_ @TesLatino Over time, all countries
@blueorigin Congrats!
@TesLatino We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. 

It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. 

That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.
@vincent13031925 Great to hear!
@blueorigin Best of luck tomorrow!
@SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Haha
@TLPN_Official @SpaceX Depending on progress with Booster 4, we might try a 9 engine firing on Booster 3

@Teslarati Improving permit approval speed &amp; lowering permit costs for solar would make a big difference
@TeslaNY Do you even press?
@enn_nafnlaus @jpr007 @TesLatino @klwtts Indeed, but again like a parking lot, a battery having big “roads” tends to decrease number of “parking spaces” (ie stores less energy)
@RationalEtienne @etherkragg Those are major factors
@AustinTeslaClub @SpaceX @austinbarnard45 @PPathole @TeslaOwnersEBay @bluemoondance74 @teslaownersSV @JohnnaCrider1 @TeslaNY Absolutely!
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Probably Monday
@FrenchieEAP @karpathy FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta 10 hopefully (Beta 11 definitely) will use one stack to rule them all – city streets, highway &amp; complex parking lots.
@Erdayastronaut @Model3Owners How about a wifi camera link?
@BLKMDL3 @Model3Owners In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better.

No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door.

Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX @PortCanaveral Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.
@Model3Owners To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. 

I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t. 

Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.
@TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”. 

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full.
@jpr007 Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range. 

Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW, so that will help too.
@AdrianoinJapan @Kristennetten Yeah, I wuz running on almost no sleep
@TeslaGong @ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Some traffic could just go terminal -&gt; satellite -&gt; satellite -&gt; terminal and never touch the regular Internet
@JxckSweeney @jack Good point
@ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX If we can do this successfully, then anything developed for ground/undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit
@ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Similar to fiber optic. We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function, but modified for use in vacuum.
@PPathole Yeah
@PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber
@Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms.
@jack 🙏 

A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great
@crheller @SpaceX Glad it’s working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing. 

Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. We’re aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink.

@bluewalletio Any money transmitter or other licenses needed to use this in USA?
@astro_g_dogg Took more work to make F9 booster reuse cost-effective than went into recovering it in the first place. This is an important point.

@vincent13031925 Final decision made earlier this week on booster engine count. Will be 33 at ~230 (half million lbs) sea-level thrust. All engines on booster are same, apart from deleting gimbal &amp; thrust vector actuators for outer 20.
@richardbranson @virgingalactic Congratulations, beautiful flight!
@richardbranson @virgingalactic Godspeed!
@SciGuySpace Yes. It will be the highest output &amp; most advanced rocket engine factory in the world.
@WatchersTank @Erdayastronaut The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor
@austinbarnard45 Thanks Austin :)
@GokuAurelius @Erdayastronaut Roughly 800 to 1000 per year. That’s about what’s needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly 20 years, so hopefully it is built by ~2050.
@Erdayastronaut McGregor
@Erdayastronaut By “volume production”, I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. That’s super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards.
@Erdayastronaut We are breaking ground soon on a second Raptor factory at SpaceX Texas test site. This will focus on volume production of Raptor 2, while California factory will make Raptor Vacuum &amp; new, experimental designs.
@DirtyTesla @vincent13031925 Yeah, goal is to reflect reality, so screen render will become increasingly so
@28delayslater @karpathy Accurate assessment. 

Btw, Autopilot software is technically led by Ashok, Andrej &amp; Milan, but it’s very much a “knights of the round table” structure. 

There are so many talented engineers on Autopilot/AI team &amp; they decide for themselves what to work on. Kinda like Valve.
@vincent13031925 Mind of car visualization will improve a lot in coming releases.

@DJSnM We could stretch the Falcon Heavy upper stage &amp; increase this a lot, but FH already covers all known payloads.

@DavidNagySFgang Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension, as with ship. Engines extend about 3m below booster.
@SmileSimplify @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius It’s one possibility
@RenataKonkoly @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Kinda has to happen :)
@thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.

Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). 

Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe …
@MarcusHouse @artzius All Raptors on booster, whether fixed or gimbaling, would be the same. 33*230 gets ~7600 tons of thrust &amp; T/W of ~1.5.
@Astro_Elliott @MarcusHouse @artzius Looking good at ~378 sec. Continued improvement will get it over 380.
Happy 4th to all!

@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition.
@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDt

In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter.
@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL
@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. 

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload.
@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R
Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S
@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. 

In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V.

Not ok.
@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement. 

If this is not true, then you won’t have a problem removing it.

Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source. 

Seems a little inconsistent …
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero.
@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements
Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️
@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.
@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.
@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.

@katlinegrey @lrocket @Alexis_wwww Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder.
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel.
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes, exciting potential
@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly
@annerajb @lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet.
@DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
@lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!
@JaneidyEve Thank you Evelyn, I loved it
@alexmd2 @JPUConn @WSJ Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system.

@nextspaceflight It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
@nextspaceflight Yes, lot of risk
@TGMetsFan98 @nextspaceflight Guys, I have feelings … 😜
@flcnhvy @rogiermaas @SpaceX Focusing on Starship instead
@rogiermaas @SpaceX Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
@Erdayastronaut @CanzyD Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters.
@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so
@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.
@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.
@SpaceXUpdates Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
@abbygarrettX @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.

Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.
@gavbrowne @bluemoondance74 @DanAloni @Kell31213876 @Vadim15258417 @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SN2 has changes that should help

@DanAloni @Kell31213876 @Vadim15258417 @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.
@Kell31213876 @Vadim15258417 @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don’t know
@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd
@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.
@wonderofscience So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
@Tom_Heats @coindesk Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
@katlinegrey I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes. https://t.co/3r6ZqEc30A
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.

@John_Gardi @w0lfyxD @Robotbeat @SpaceX Starship &amp; Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version 1. Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is 2/3 vehicle mass &amp; helium weighs basically nothing.

@McMurchie @SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper
@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.
@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs
@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.

@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
@Malcolmmarsman @Erdayastronaut Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
@Erdayastronaut Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
@Erdayastronaut The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy

@nickynaptime Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn’t even need paint!
@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas https://t.co/8JCOi1BG6z
@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine
@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
@CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
@teslamodel3fan @Tesla Since it’s part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it
Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
@DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
@thecla6771 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
@PopMech When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

@cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication
@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of 3/Y for greater China. All Model S/X &amp; higher cost versions of Model 3/Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China.
@jimcramer Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China, not North America. Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers.
Shanghai Giga production of Model 3/Y will serve greater China region
Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model 3 production end of year &amp; reach high volume production next year
Looking forward to breaking ground on the @Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory today!
Good sign that almost no Model 3 owners want to sell their cars!

Exactly
@realpfigueiredo @MarioNawfal Interesting
@BasedMikeLee It was a radical left propaganda machine
Grok is getting better fast
Grok it
[Cracks Knuckles]
@Rich_Cooper Teslas rock
@MarioNawfal Doesn’t De Moraes own property in America?
It’s not just that borders were “left open”. 

There was a massive, concerted campaign to usher in as many illegals as possible on an unprecedented scale in order to achieve permanent one-party rule. 

Treason.
Good luck, you have my full endorsement!
Awesome 😎
@ImMeme0 Troubling
@MarioNawfal At this point, everyone knows that Bill Owens crafted a deliberate lie.

Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance.

Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump
Great!
Soros leveraged tens of billions of dollars of government funding, domestically and abroad
The email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send!

 https://t.co/P5oZ49BcBF
@RapidResponse47 @SecDef The right response
Twitter added far more features with fewer people. 

What really matters for improving American’s standard of living is shifting people from low productivity jobs in government to high productivity jobs in industry. 

Many more people needed in manufacturing!

@EndymionYT Yeah

@DerrickEvans4WV What did Chris Christie get done this week? 

(Buffet bars don’t count)
The President was clear
@kylaschwaberow Jerry is an utter liar. 

I have always paid extremely generous child support and without any coercion to do so. 

Sometimes the mother asked for money vastly in excess of what the children could possibly need, so that needed to be adjudicated.

This is an extremely important insight.

The public votes overwhelmingly in favor.
@BasedMikeLee Crazy

Then it is only a matter of time before @AfD wins
Those who ignored President Trump’s executive order to return to work have now received over a month’s warning. 

Starting this week, those who still fail to return to office will be placed on administrative leave.
@DaleStarkA10 They now need to do real work that is of real value to their fellow citizens. 

Definitely better for society and for them in the long run
Smaller government is the only way to restore your freedom

Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!
@torybruno Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.
@JRossNicoll This is an important improvement

@ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! 

We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!
@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.
@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.

@heydave7 Well said, Dave!
@Teslaconomics The long-term strength of Tesla will be manufacturing technology
@MattWallace888 Wow, thanks!
@LloydOstertagg @SpaceX Thanks Lloyd!
@BTCTN A new space race has begun!
@ModelYendofICE At the annual shareholder meeting! Probably late July / early August.
0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.
Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid is just so good.
Model S goes to Plaid speed this week
@WatchersTank @BillyM2k VIC-20 with 8KB memory
@KennyLoaded @BillyM2k Some engineers I worked with went on to help create WoW, but it was too addicting. Couldn’t afford the time (sigh).
@BillyM2k Tbh, I was into PC &amp; still into PC
@WholeMarsBlog One more production release of pure vision this week, then FSD beta 9 a week or two later. V9.0 FSD is also pure vision. Foundational improvements are immense.
@LarsEdelmann1 @Jamie_ORourke @Tesla Maybe
@Jamie_ORourke I do like to cause a little mischief
@PPathole @hag7447 He will perhaps have a baby soon
@teslaownersSV The operating costs of a Tesla are also much lower than a gasoline cruiser!
I guess we read the instructions haha
Don’t kill what you hate,
Save what you love
@RationalEtienne @Jason Fair point. Back to regularly scheduled programming.
@Jason Haha awesome
Goods &amp; services are the real economy, any form of money is simply the accounting thereof
@lexfridman @VitalikButerin @ethereum @Bitcoin @dogecoin @ShibainuCoin @IOHK_Charles @Cardano @chainlink @0xPolygon I pretty much agree with Vitalik
@Fredilly … is a helluva drug 🤣🤣
@flcnhvy It is
@Corpse_Husband @archillect Already have one
@RTHowell Make up sex is the best tho
@CryptoWhale Great thread 🤣
@coinbase Nice
@JRNYcrypto Needs laser eyes too
@teslaownersSV Thanks :) Seriously, it was so insane! Fud still happening a little, but doesn’t resonate when enough people have the product.
@Neuro_Skeptic Some quarks &amp; a lepton walk into a bar …
@eamokeane Things get weird at the driver level
@WholeMarsBlog That’s where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs &amp; mid range cars.
@teslaownersSV We went public for $3.40/share!
@PPathole @SpaceX Science-fiction should not be fiction forever!
@ErcXspace @austinbarnard45 @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight Might take a few kicks at the can before we catch the rocket haha
@p_ferragu Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. 

Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.

That said, it’s obv not a long-term issue.
Found this pic of me as a child https://t.co/hUEKluRAdP

@dogeofficialceo @SouthPark When I visit Japan later this year
@SouthPark Baby Shark crushes all! More views than humans. https://t.co/48Ol3ZzhjP
@itsALLrisky Sounds kinda fun
@WorldofTesla1 Yeah, new Model S &amp; X have PS5 level entertainment computing power
@DocumentingBTC Nice
@jeremyjudkins @Ryanth3nerd @Tesla Agreed
@Model3Owners Making this work has been / still is super difficult, but it’s a revolution in car body design &amp; production – lighter, tighter, better NVH, higher precision, lower capex, lower unit cost
@Ryanth3nerd @Tesla Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used.

Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially.
@ErcXspace @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight @MarcusHouse Pretty close. Inner ring is closer to center 3, as all 12 gimbal together. Boost back burn efficiency is greatly improved in this config.
Ocean spaceport Deimos is under construction for launch next year
@PPathole @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @SpaceX Actually, so-called “secondary” structure is the hard part – so many pipes &amp; wires. 

Tall stuff &amp; small stuff are the toughest things about Starship.
@RationalEtienne @kimbal True
@UniverCurious @TechInsider 250M years is only ~6% increase in age of Earth
@Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @SpaceX Raptor production is approaching one every 48 hours
@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @SpaceX 29 Raptors on Booster initially, rising to 32 later this year, along with thrust increase per engine. Aiming for &gt;7500 ton thrust long-term. T/W ~1.5.
@blockfolio Great idea
@teslaownersSV @TeslaNY Dark Helmet emotes Plaid well
@OwenSparks_ @TeslaNY Actually true haha
@TeslaNY Basically, our entire product roadmap is from Spaceballs 🤣🤣
@boringcompany Congrats Boring Company team!
Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak.

This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance.
@skorusARK Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km.
@KosukeGoto2013 I suspect that name made him strong
@blueorigin For the low, low price of … ?
Ship 16 &amp; Booster 2, Starbase Highbay https://t.co/IUuidOw9ym
@Model3Owners Tesla sure would appreciate changing the law, so that this is not required!
@waitbutwhy @poweredbyart Exactly
@RationalEtienne @SciGuySpace Potentially, 1000 times higher
@AlexSvanArt @Neopork85 Pretty close. No tiles on back side of flaps. Some tiles towards leeward side of ship trailing plasma spilling off rear of flaps.
@SciGuySpace Cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. Falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing 12 months.
If only they had spaceships, they’d still be around

@Astro_Elliott @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Aiming to have hot gas thrusters on booster for first orbital flight
@IlyaRosenberg @Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 They are now the same (LOX below CH4). Ox is 3.5 times heavier than fuel, so makes sense to have it lower.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Exactly 🤣🤣
@Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 Lot of plumbing!
@itsALLrisky Please note Dogecoin has no formal organization &amp; no one reports to me, so my ability to take action is limited
@heydave7 @dogecoin_devs Doge has dogs &amp; memes, whereas the others do not
Someone suggested changing Dogecoin fees based on phases of the moon, which is pretty awesome haha
If you’d like to help develop Doge, please submit ideas on GitHub &amp; https://t.co/liAPQMFaQB @dogecoin_devs
Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current &amp; planned renewable usage &amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.
@Cointelegraph He fears the … https://t.co/78WzM5ICjA
@SpaceNews_Inc Congrats! @virgingalactic
@flcnhvy @thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Becoming multiplanetary is one of the greatest filters. Only now, 4.5 billion years after Earth formed, is it possible. 

How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not. 

In case it is the latter, we should act now.
@PPathole @SpaceX The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it
@TheRealShifo The true battle is between fiat &amp; crypto. On balance, I support the latter.
Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology
@RocketRundown Welcome to the future. It’s gonna be great.
@jimfarley98 Congrats!
@teslaownersSV This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate 🖤 irony haha.
@AstroJordy @Tesla We can’t wait to build this crazy truck! It’s a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end.
@BTCsessions @TeslaGong @wintonARK Achieving truly decentralized finance – power to the people – is a noble &amp; important goal. 

Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo.

For now, Lightning is needed.
@TeslaGong @wintonARK Ideally 0.1kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate
@BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @wintonARK Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition – same as a hardcore roller coaster.
@TeslaGong @wintonARK Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
@wintonARK I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.

This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not.
@heydave7 Yeah, I haven’t &amp; won’t sell any Doge
@heydave7 A longtime Tesla supporter gave me the Doge dollar sticker at Giga Berlin
@flcnhvy @MarcusHouse Oh sorry, yes, Roadster will have thrusters, not Plaid. Plaid is indeed close to the theoretical maximum of a roadworthy car without special devices.
@MarcusHouse It will have high pressure air rocket thrusters behind a license plate that flips down. Bong, James Bong …
@austinbarnard45 Good idea
@austinbarnard45 Sure
@thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Worth reading
@WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Currency is already digital! Decentralized crypto is an attempt to wrest power of currency dilution (pernicious form of taxation) &amp; capital controls from governments. That said, I sure hope the cure is better than the disease!

Mars/AI are essential to passing the great filter/s.
@TeslaGong That is my gaming laptop, which has never had a sticker until now
@Teslarati Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use.
How much is that Doge in the window? https://t.co/bxTkWOr50V
Tesla Model S Plaid delivery event

@SenBillNelson I would like to second that congratulations. Outstanding accomplishment by China!
Credit to our Master of Coin
@Tesmanian_com Ferragu is remarkably insightful
@joergstb Great progress so far! Thank you for the support from Brandenburg. I would also like to express appreciation for the permit authorities, as I know this is a large and complex project. 

When all the finishing touches are done, I hope it will be considered a jewel of Brandenburg!
Aiming for extreme precision with next gen Model Y – microns, not millimeters
Giga Berlin suppliers please accelerate!
@PPathole I worked for Peter Nicholson, who is awesome. Mostly, we exchanged math riddles, although I did figure out a multi-billion dollar arbitrage opportunity for the bank. Figured they’d at least give me $1/hour raise, but no … https://t.co/rdjDtPtPHz
@vincent13031925 Going through all aspects of next gen Model Y production system with team. Lot of talented people at Giga Berlin. This place will rock!
@BTC_Archive To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin
@CryptoWhale Indeed
@ChainLinkGod @PeterMcCormack Hey cryptocurrency “experts”, ever heard of PayPal? It’s possible … maybe … that I know than you realize about how money works.
@ChainLinkGod @PeterMcCormack Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies. 

A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound “decentralized” to you?

https://t.co/Oom8yzGRNQ
@poisonouspinups @michael_saylor He should wear outfit for Halloween, but with “Bitcoin” tattooed high on thighs
@michael_saylor Saylor Moon
@PeterMcCormack Obnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on Doge
@TeslaHype Coming soon. Sorry for the delay!
@loshan1212 @itsALLrisky For those bad at math 👆, 100X higher transaction volume with 100X lower fees means total fees earned stay same. Low fees &amp; high volume are needed to become currency of Earth.
@PPathole @long_elon @itsALLrisky My understanding is that the big accounts are exchanges. Would be good to confirm though. Am told the biggest one is Robinhood.
@long_elon @itsALLrisky Only if Doge can’t do it. Big pain in the neck to create another one.
@itsALLrisky Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X &amp; drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.
@SciGuySpace Yes, hardware-in-the-loop testing of software is essential
@DJSnM We need to make sure ship won’t break up on reentry, hence deorbit over Pacific
@teslaownersSV 3/4 of the way around the Earth
As always https://t.co/gtFmtokzEZ
@SpaceNews_Inc @googlecloud Locating ground stations at data centers will significantly improve latency &amp; jitter. Data can go from user terminal to server without touching the Internet.
Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.
@ID_AA_Carmack I have a lot of respect for anyone who ships useful product at scale. It is insanely hard work.
To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal
It is high time there was a carbon tax!
Energy usage trend over past few months is insane https://t.co/E6o9s87trw https://t.co/bmv9wotwKe
@WholeMarsBlog Haha
@garyblack00 Subscription rolls out in about a month
@Dreamweaver2oh @garyblack00 I think we’re maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately. 

The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD, so much more progress has been made than it would seem.
@flcnhvy @garyblack00 End of year, along with FSD, provided we get regulatory approval. Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD.
@garyblack00 We had to focus on removing radar &amp; confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD &amp; v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 &amp; v9 is gigantic.
Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?

@MeetLuis @WARREZ420 @WholeMarsBlog Rawlinson was never chief engineer. He arrived after Model S prototype was made, left before things got tough &amp; was only ever responsible for body engineering, not powertrain, battery, software, production or design.

A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work, as the entire road system is designed for biological neural nets with optical imagers
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly!
@teslaownersSV Was using this in my car last night
@teslaownersSV FSD display V9.0 will show actual probability distribution of objects – true mind’s eye of the neural net. This is so cool!
@WhatsupFranks @danheld I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible!
@adamcarter @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla True. Anyone paying attention to the rate of improvement will realize that Tesla Autopilot/FSD is already superhuman for highway driving &amp; swiftly getting there for city streets.
@jgrano305 @tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Hopefully, later this year for several more states. Insurance is different for almost every state in America &amp; regulatory approvals take time.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla And hopefully EU this summer
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Probably a few months. There are many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada driving.
@teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Gating factor is achieving &amp; proving higher safety with pure vision than with vision+radar. We are almost there.

FSD Beta V9.0 will blow your mind.
@teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Probably two weeks

@leastImAlive @thesheetztweetz They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo. 

Strange that they aren’t taking more action on some of the SPACs.
@thesheetztweetz FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time, I agree with regulators! 

On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn’t anticipate.
@garyblack00 Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product. 

I trust the people.
@garyblack00 @CGrantWSJ @WSJ I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists, rather than publications. 

Any given publication is going to have wide range of views, albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative, perhaps reflecting innate human biases.

Citizen journalism FTW!
Starship SN15 static fire completed, preparing for flight later this week
@jeff_foust True 🤣🤣
@kchangnyt Can’t get it up (to orbit) lol
@heydave7 Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in 2022 &amp; possibly total units in 2023
@stoolpresidente No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.
@Orangetilt Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels. 

What’s really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!
@PPathole An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer, so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)

@AstroJordy I’m staying at a friend’s place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall. 

When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don’t even flicker. Owner says he doesn’t notice.
@28delayslater Does seem a little weird
@JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”, then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”. 

If that’s an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths …
Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
@jack True
@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.
@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.
Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. 

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. 

Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.
Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.
Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery
@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.
@TeslaNY Sandy Munro knows what he’s talking about

@RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha
@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
@NASA Awesome!
@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! 

Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.

Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!
@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.
Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.
@thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.
@lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!
@austinbarnard45 Aiming to launch next week

@RationalEtienne @F9Block5 While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.

Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it’s hopeless. This is insanely hard.

@WholeMarsBlog Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing.
@cliffski @F9Block5 Hopefully addressed this summer
@BLKMDL3 @F9Block5 Same timing
@F9Block5 Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.

This is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.
@jrosinski97 Will investigate
@melaniemadri Probably late July

@PPathole @SwiftOnSecurity Getting there
@AstroJordy @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That version of Falcon 1 never flew, so must be ~2004. The CAD looks so simple! I think we were still using SolidWorks back then.
@eugenelee3 @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla Yeah, not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level.
@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.
@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla True. Ancient times … Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow.
@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Absolutely
@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.

@tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.
@WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.
@WholeMarsBlog When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.

@IheartTesla Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3.
Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again

@IvanEscobosa Latter
To be clear, I do support vaccines in general &amp; covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. 

In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen.
@DavidWillisSLS @_Jevis_ @PPathole Needs legs for moon &amp; Mars
@SciGuySpace Global payload to orbit is the key metric
@Julius_Burton @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @NASASpaceflight @ChrisG_NSF @thejackbeyer @FelixSchlang Nice
@_Jevis_ @PPathole Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal “glide” with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).
@PPathole Starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour.

Will report conclusions as soon as we know them.
Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
@OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!
@OwenSparks_ Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.
Probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome
Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2. 

Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.
Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so! 

SpaceX’s hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly.
@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0
@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact.
@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. 

Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days.
@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.
@SpaceX At least the crater is in the right place!
@SpaceX A high production rate solves many ills
@Tesmanian_com Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year.

Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets.
@WholeMarsBlog The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.
@TheMarsSociety SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary — full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth.

@WholeMarsBlog Like @CyberpunkGame, but *with* self-driving haha
@PPathole @arstechnica @SciGuySpace If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. 

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.

Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
@PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster
@ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
@NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. 

Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
@austinbarnard45 SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.

@arctechinc Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems.
@LarryKellogg @arctechinc The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option.
Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing. 

Note: word “Beta” is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.
Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days

@Rjdlandscapes @Tesla Prices in the US (of all goods) don’t include VAT, but it’s usually included in other countries.

Or did they say pegged to the dollar? Something like that …
Heard a rumor some crypto coin was pegging the dollar 🤣🤣
@MIT_CSAIL Machine learning is so amaze!
@PPathole @dogecoin Just some used Antminer L3+ rigs bought off eBay. Not really economic, but it was a fun family project.
@WholeMarsBlog Most people have no idea, even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away. 

There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better.

Tesla is solving a major real-world AI problem.
@dogecoin I just set up some little Doge mining rigs with my kids. It was fun.
@PeterSchiff That said, BTC &amp; ETH do seem high lol
@PeterSchiff An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.

Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.

That data, like all data, is subject to latency &amp; error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.
I just want to start a flame in your heart
Just for a day
@NASA Congratulations!!
@realfuckingnews @business Somehow, a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods &amp; services!? Amazing.
@business To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. 

However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere. 

Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is “almost”.
@business Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company.
@Teslarati SpaceX in south Texas &amp; Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant). Please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways.

@BrennanChant @SpaceX Yeah. Active fairing half recovered though.
@rockstardenied @SpaceX SpaceX Boca team is helping save the turtles
@ogeNews1 @ShaunStoffer Disturbing concentration
@itsALLrisky Absolutely
I will literally pay actual $ if they just void their accounts
@JaneidyEve Temporarily lower, long-term raise
@RationalEtienne An acceptable percentage. Doge is much more concentrated.
If major Dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo.

@BLKMDL3 @RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well, Starlink will IPO
@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we don’t fail, the cost to end users will improve every year.
@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.
@ID_AA_Carmack Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made.

@CapybaraSurfer @MattWallace888 Does seem a bit high
@itsALLrisky Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.

Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster.

@redlineshifter Just a scratch
Much wow!
@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they’re already there
@josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land

We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device &amp; shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know.
@Teslarati @BocaChicaGal The legs extend &amp; telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for SN4+

@teslaownersSV Seeing friends
Hello from the Inside
https://t.co/SV3fWL3bkp
@microdentist And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C19
@n2179_twit @AbbottNews This sounds great
@AbbottNews Can you do a fast antibody test?
Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you’re immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind.
@PPathole @VitalVegas Buzzfeed is a mind virus
@VitalVegas Also makes for a great shelter https://t.co/f991AJD2mU
@AlexSafahi @NYCMayor We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them
@kshah07 @yosefontwo @JSellMafia @NYCMayor Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
@NYCMayor Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.
@NYCMayor You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
@thirdrowtesla Exactly. Douglas Adams knew what he was talking about.
@FidelCatsro @AlexBerenson .@mayemusk Care to comment?
@teslaownersSV @Teslarati Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, we’re delivering Resmed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight.
@MartianDays Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation
@flcnhvy @Tesla Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
@enscand @PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard. https://t.co/Dz2Nio5ddi
@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
@flcnhvy @Tesla Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
This meme proves it https://t.co/3CHAzxv6dj
It’s ducked!
@SamTalksTesla @MikeBloomberg True. @MikeBloomberg, this is  accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity, but if something isn’t done, this will continue.
@steezyysosa @TesLatino @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MikeBloomberg @Twitter Have let @twitter know
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla This is messed up @MikeBloomberg
@JBNielsen1985 @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Both
@InSpaceXItrust @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water &amp; just dump it on the ground.
@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly
@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you’re expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
@romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
@stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter
@ajtourville @Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
@Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
@BocachicaMaria1 Will do
@teslaownersSV @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly
@jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.
@engineers_feed Engineering ftw
@flyLAXairport Much appreciated
@PPathole @BBCScienceNews Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
@BBCScienceNews Worrisome
@JohnnaCrider1 @thirdrowtesla We’ll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @SalehCU Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
@engineers_feed Nice
@JohnCleese This is great advice
@uwdrwaldorf @Tesla @omead_a @UWMedicine Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
@justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
@NativeCACV @Tesla @omead_a You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
@benikbeno @CDCgov Panic is always dumb
@Guruleaks1 @benikbeno Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”
@CDCgov Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
@Jennerator211 We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :)
@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
@Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :)
@RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
@NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”. https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@friedberg Feels like the plot of Deus Ex https://t.co/R8tmw048JM
@MG42bonesaw A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
@RenataKonkoly @moskov Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too
@moskov That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can’t stay open
@EdLudlow Yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won’t be needed
@alandrummond2 Interesting thread
@DOfaquarius @PPathole Thanks 💖
@Cernovich China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
@DOfaquarius @PPathole We’re working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
@flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.
@RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
@PPathole Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
No new domestic corona cases in China https://t.co/lGmxRvMyFy
@westcoastbill Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@NYCMayor @NateSilver538 Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
@DisruptResearch @Jason True
@Jason Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already.
@suhaylabbas @fawadchaudhry We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
@cleantechnica Some helpful data from Italy https://t.co/3taxq5NXcZ
@cleantechnica Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New “confirmed” cases, not oft-reported “presumptive positive” is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China. 
https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@cleantechnica 0% chance of anything close
@RiganoESQ @DiderRaoult How does this compare to favipiravir? https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn’t a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won’t risk non-SpaceX satellites.
@KMastersBarnes @SpaceX Yeah, most reflights ever!
@SciGuySpace Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.

@fael097 Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines &amp; add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small.
Hydroxychloroquine probably better
https://t.co/FWn2kh1LZx https://t.co/wQODHiFeWT
@PPathole Sounds sensible
That said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses. Track graph at bottom of this page: https://t.co/7nWKjiZyFn

@Sofiaan @RenataKonkoly @meckimac Yeah https://t.co/yp3pBn4prV
@RenataKonkoly @meckimac I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts &amp; sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt …
@meckimac Was also given a lot of doxycycline https://t.co/hn0BzsIatz
@Gundament Maybe helpful
@meckimac Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn’t mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing.
Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr

@Techmeme @YunLi626 Market was bit high anyway, so due for a correction
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut Static fire &amp; short flights with SN3, longer flights with SN4, but spooling up the whole Starship/Raptor production line is really what matters
@Erdayastronaut SN2 (with thrust puck) passed cryo pressure &amp; engine thrust load tests late last night
@nypost He studied the blade
@EvaFoxU Memes are powerful
@PPathole @FxzzOnTheBeat Ships with a lot of people &amp; limited medical facilities are a serious issue
@lexfridman Yeah, that’s a great one
@FxzzOnTheBeat Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!
@FxzzOnTheBeat Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!
@War_Remains @HardcoreHistory Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.
@cosmicdatabase Yeah
Accurate
Envelope expanded
@Alejandro_DebH Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason.
Rocket will land in highest winds ever at Cape Canaveral tonight. This is intentional envelope expansion.

@justpaulinelol @Erdayastronaut @Sofiaan @Tesla We’re making progress. Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees. Hopefully better in a few months.
@Erdayastronaut @Sofiaan @Tesla Cool, we’re tracking to release more FSD features later this month
@Sofiaan @Tesla True. Oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery.
Mad respect for the makers of things
@Teslarati No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated.

@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @JakeTheHuman28 @tesla_truth @Twitter Sure

@RationalEtienne @Bryr32 Full disclosure, I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!
@Bryr32 We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat &amp; strong, we’re building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement.

Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing https://t.co/5hqRhjP4bV
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @Teslarati Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact
@Erdayastronaut @Teslarati It’s slightly better
@nichegamer Definitely worth trying imo
@Teslarati Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
@Teslarati Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far https://t.co/Ky65Q3s3JX
@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
@PPathole @JohnHanzl It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
@JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
@flcnhvy @sydney_ev Probably
@sydney_ev Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad
@RationalEtienne I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done! https://t.co/G9h0430ns2
@pentaquarky @Erdayastronaut The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.
@Erdayastronaut O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
@tesletter In the order that they were written

@tobyliiiiiiiiii SN 2+ will have better fit &amp; weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length.

@TeslaGong @_KarenHao @OpenAI I have no control &amp; only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high.
@_KarenHao @OpenAI OpenAI should be more open imo
@vincent13031925 Initially, yes, but then will make sense to localize closer to customers. Pretty much same plan as vehicles.

@Inzilya777 @archillect 🛰 albedo will drop significantly on almost every successive launch
@litgenstein Haha
@archillect Sorry, probably going to be a lot of rocket pics from @archillect 🤣🤣
@BLKMDL3 @jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason X will also improve by a similar amount
@jgrano305 @BLKMDL3 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 &amp; 390
@jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +
@DMC_Ryan @Jason There’s a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.
@PPathole Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
@PPathole Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km https://t.co/sNFzIkuJpC

@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @robert_zubrin Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
@Erdayastronaut @robert_zubrin Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light.

@Teslarati This is incorrect. No air suspension planned for 3/Y. Only S/X &amp; Cybertruck have/will have air suspension.
The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours.
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home
@dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year
@TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
@_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
@G_d_Photographr Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.
@yourfavgas Probably 6 months or so. 301 is certainly fine for orbit, but SpaceX 30X will be better.

@Revoeh020 @Tesla Yes, but we want to focus on textured black first, then move into Earth tones &amp; convolutions
@SamTalksTesla Your comment above: “Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after 2025 knowing its residual value will be zilch? Legacy auto: go EV or go BUST!” is super important for car buyers. Residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years.

@RationalEtienne @Tesla @kimbal Haha true
@JaneidyEve You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume.
@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
SpaceX started with a mariachi band party. Great vibes here in Boca Chica, Texas!

@Erdayastronaut Have you tried a hydrophobic spray?
This is mainly for staffing up 4 production shifts for 24/7 operations, but engineers, supervisors &amp; support personnel are certainly needed too. A super hardcore work ethic, talent for building things, common sense &amp; trustworthiness are required, the rest we can train.
Starship career day at the Stargate building (Boca Chica Blvd, TX) this Thursday from 3pm to 9pm!
Going max hardcore on design/production Starship here in Boca. It’s awesome! Feels a bit like a Mars simulator.
@justpaulinelol @reto_siegrist @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Definitely!
@CathieDWood @sbarnettARK @jwangARK @ARKInvest First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
Nothing medically dangerous, but 5g is getting a bit too greedy with their spectrum land grab
@TeslaGong @indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I’m unaware of
@indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
@TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.
@DOfaquarius @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It’s *awesome*.
@ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Probably this summer
@ajtourville @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.
@PPathole PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.
@CathieDWood @ARKInvest The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
@TheReal_Psyche Sorry!
@SamTalksTesla A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
@John_Gardi Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency
Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin
Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.
Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with
“At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn’t just icing on the cake, it the cake” - @lexfridman

@justpaulinelol @nichegamer This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things https://t.co/qSfqTpfzb2
@justpaulinelol @nichegamer Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.

Incarceration for contempt of court, even when valid, should not be for such an egregious length of time. 

When compared to the many crimes that receive little to no prison time, this cannot be considered fair or just.

More than half of American voters voted for Trump. He won the popular vote by a decisive margin!

Cutting someone off just because they voted for the other candidate is close-minded and just plain mean.
They are basically the same picture. 

Banning voter ID makes fraudulent voting by non-citizens easy. 

Making a state or city a “sanctuary” for illegals then maximizes the potential total of fraudulent votes. 

Understanding the incentives explains seemingly irrational behavior.

This could (of course) only be used between trans lunar orbit and lunar surface, given no heat shield or flaps.

If those ships don’t increment the crater count on Mars, then crewed ships can be sent in 4 years.

Being able to land the ship, refill propellant &amp; launch right away with no refurbishment or laborious inspection. That is the acid test.

Current Starship is more than twice as powerful as the Saturn V Moon rocket.

Starship V3, which hopefully flies in about a year, will be 3X more powerful.
The objectives for Starship Flight 6 are:

1. Restart of Raptor engines in vacuum.
2. Daylight landing of the ship.
3. Higher peak heating (steeper) reentry.
4. Faster/harder booster catch. 

There are thousands of small design changes also being tested.

As for these accusations against him, I consider them worth less than nothing. Under our laws, a man is considered innocent until proven guilty. 

If AG Garland (an unprincipled douchebag) could have secured a conviction against Gaetz, he would have, but he knew he could not.
Matt Gaetz has 3 critical assets that are needed for the AG role: a big brain, a spine of steel and an axe to grind. 

He is the Judge Dredd America needs to clean up a corrupt system and put powerful bad actors in prison.

Gaetz will be our Hammer of Justice.
And we will

Starlink is how we are paying for humanity to get to Mars. 

That’s why there is a Hohmann transfer orbit diagram on the Starlink router.
Moreover, much of the fraud is driven by organized theft rings from other countries, so a lot of it is not even going to American crooks, which is extra galling!
That is just the tip of the iceberg.

The actual fraud and waste in government spending is much higher.
Yes, the legacy (formerly mainstream) media just literally lied relentlessly

If you look closely, you can see a human walking around the base of the rocket. 

Each Raptor rocket engine produces twice as much thrust as all 4 engines on a 747. 

There are 33 Raptor engines powering the Starship rocket booster.

Becoming multiplanetary will greatly increase the lifespan of our civilization and it is the critical next step to becoming multistellar
The latter
@DefiyantlyFree Yeah
Trust in the legacy media is rightfully at an all-time low and declining. 

Send https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy links to friends, especially of actual source material, so that they know the truth of what’s going on.
@MikeBenzCyber Good question
Nonstop rocket launches!
Exactly right
Absolutely!
Should your tax dollars really be paying for an organization run by people who think the truth is a “distraction”?
@LKrauss1 I think so
@WesternLensman As that chart shows, nobody takes the lying legacy media seriously anymore. They are a 🤡 show 😂
@SwipeWright Yeah
Very telling
@DeAngelisCorey True
@NASASpaceflight Flight 6 is coming soon
@ElonFactsX That is what it is
@DefiyantlyFree Great idea
Any activist judge being pushed through by Pocahontas is bad for the country
@PrimeXAI @america Exactly
@RobertMSterling The trend to extinction
@allanldsantos @america I’m open to the idea
@DefiyantlyFree My pronouns are still prosecute/Fauci
And, of course, play a significant role in primaries.
Normally, PACs go somewhat dormant after a big election.

@America PAC is going to do the opposite and keep grinding, increasing Republican registrations in key districts around the country, in preparation for special elections and the midterms.
@chrissgardner Frankly, it was only on the Thursday before the Saturday that ANY of the sketches generated laughs. I was worried. 

I was like damn my SNL appearance is going to be so fucking unfunny that it will make a crackhead sober!!

But then it worked out in the end 😮‍💨
@DefiyantlyFree Does seem odd
@GadSaad @realDonaldTrump Indeed. Phew.
@MxHedroom @GadSaad Trump broke his brain
@GadSaad Yeah
@DefiyantlyFree Yeah
@ProgressingCali @stclairashley Yeah
@KonstantinKisin His Dad sounds awesome
@DefiyantlyFree Busted 🤷‍♂️

@Cernovich Sam is subtarded 😂
@Cernovich Sam Harris is an utter idiot
@Plandemic3Movie Wow, that sure is a scary alliance 🤣🤣
@DefiyantlyFree Does seem odd
@isabelleboemeke Reactors should be way bigger imo
@MarioNawfal I’m happy to be first buddy! 😂
@ajtourville It’s way too small though. Needs to be at least twice the size.
@ajtourville Looks familiar 😂
@ajtourville They are subtarded. 

A string of satellites increases bandwidth, not latency.

@amuse This is crazy
@Rothmus Yeah
The new Senate Majority Leader must respond to the will of the people
@teslaownersSV You will not find a better friend than me, nor a worse enemy
Use Grok for answers that are based on up-to-date info!
Congratulations @RealTomHoman on being given responsibility for enforcing our borders!
@charliekirk11 @RealTomHoman is BASED
@amuse Elise is awesome, but it might be too dicey to lose her from the House, at least for now
Indeed, the obstacles are overcoming the Kafkaesque nature of the rules governing this vast bureaucracy and ensuring that maniacally dedicated small-government revolutionaries join this administration!
@KaiTrumpGolfs Lil X is being such a troll 😂
Absolutely! Would be interesting to hear recommendations for roles in the new administration for consideration by the President.
@BillyM2k Wow, I don’t even want to look at mine 😂
Great!

@MarcMerrill Cool
Rick Scott for Senate Majority Leader!
𝕏 predicted the election outcome, because it represents America
Exactly!

I have great respect for the American people, who saw through the relentless propaganda and voted for change.
@realDonaldTrump This is essential. There is no other way.
Without recess appointments, it will take two years or more to confirm the new administration! 

This would make it impossible to enact the change demanded by the American people, which is utterly unacceptable.
(Republican) Senator Thune is the top choice of Democrats 🤣🤣
@WesternLensman Exactly

@PeterSweden7 I hope they attack me more

Who should be Senate Majority Leader?
Essential to stop fraud in elections
They did and they will get it

Couldn’t agree more
@clairlemon Yeah
From impossible to late
@TheRabbitHole84 Canada is dying
@DefiyantlyFree SNL has been dying slowly for years, as they become increasingly out of touch with reality.

Their last-ditch effort to cheat the equal airtime requirements and prop up Kamala before the election only helped sink her campaign further. @nbcsnl
@naval Yeah
True. 

Send them https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 to debunk the hoaxes pushed by the legacy media.
@omni_american Yes, and it would have become far worse
@MarioNawfal No way to solve speed of light latency, but we can solve for super high bandwidth
@jasondebolt She is a far left activist pretending to be a judge
@charliekirk11 Yeah
You are the media now
@NPCliberator @Rothmus That would make a big difference
@mchmr96 @MickeySteamboat @AdamLowisz @Chesschick01 Good idea

@Rothmus Almost all

@visegrad24 He won’t be in power for much longer
@CollinRugg That’s what happens when teachers lie to kids. Trump has been clear that he will veto a national abortion ban.
@GadSaad Their feedback loop is disconnected from reality. If they were on this platform, they would be more likely to understand.
@stevenmarkryan This will be next-level
@AlecStapp So many crazy regulations that aren’t in the public interest
@robbystarbuck I am encouraged by the discussion so far regarding the key members of the new administration
@TuckerCarlson @alppouch The fun police fear that someone somewhere is having a good time and they’re going stop it! 🤣🤣
Fidias has a good point
It’s crazy
It is the only way to understand the universe
The unelected and unconstitutional Federal bureaucracy currently has more power than the presidency, legislature or judiciary!

This needs to change.
@GadSaad That was a close one

Grok can explain memes
I asked Grok to generate an image of The View 😂 https://t.co/UIX2L47Sgv
Of Course I Still Love You
@amuse Yeah
@MarioNawfal @joerogan Cool
I was just reading 𝕏 and combining that with real-time swing state voting data sent to me by my @America PAC team
You can upload any image to Grok, including medical imaging and get its (non-doctor) opinion. 

Grok accurately diagnosed a friend of mine from his scans.
That is why
@amuse There were an encouraging number of Trump/Vance signs around Austin
@ArthurMacwaters @ajtourville A weekly email of accomplishments seems like it should be mandatory for all government employees

Just put some donuts on the table and make sure he doesn’t knock you over on his way to eat them.

The legacy media lied to you
 https://t.co/TuylN2IqYi
The legacy media wants to destroy your right to freedom of speech.

They are saying it out loud and repeatedly.

Time is up for the warmonger profiteers.
This is just a very basic first step. 

Earth and Mars will ultimately need &gt;petabit/sec connectivity.
@shaunmmaguire Incentives drive behavior
@EndWokeness This is such bs. Joe Rogan is a great human being and everyone knows it!

That’s why he has a vastly bigger audience than MSNBC, which peddles puerile propaganda.
@ILA_NewsX Sowell was brilliant
@Travis_4_Trump Yeah, they lost their minds when a single bus load of illegals was sent there, but have no empathy at all for small towns in the Midwest that are deluged with tens of thousands of illegals
@shaunmmaguire Yeah
@MarioNawfal Most importantly, American taxpayer money will be spent far more effectively and for projects that are truly inspiring
Government handouts at the national and state level enable illegals who come here to have a standard of living that is better than half of Earth. 

This creates a forcing function for half of Earth to move here.

They will do so, unless the border is secure. 

QED.

In a properly functioning democracy, the people should get what the people want!

This was the Democratic Party platform not that long ago.
@StephenM @realDonaldTrump The American people have made it absolutely clear that they utterly reject the current ruling class. 

Radical reform of government is what they want.
@AutismCapital Barron is great
Propaganda is far less effective when there is a real-time source of truth on 𝕏
For anyone, whether in America or other countries, who finds this result shocking, they should reconsider where they get their information. 

This trend was obvious on 𝕏 for months, but almost all the legacy mainstream media pushed a completely false reality.

They lied to you.
@markpinc This is nuts. Schools are pushing radical leftist ideology on students instead of actually teaching them things!
Arizona just declared for @realDonaldTrump, making it a clean sweep of all swing states!

Massive red wave success! It is beyond a landslide, as Republicans won:

– Presidency
– Popular vote
– Senate majority
– House majority

@PeterSweden7 Wow, that shows what level of propaganda they are being fed!

Democrat vs Republican early voting in Pennsylvania was better for Dems than 2020 until just after 10/10.

Below are the R minus D early vote deltas in swing states before tomorrow. 

Republican turnout on election day is usually much higher than Democrat, so any state currently leaning R in early voting is very likely to side with Trump.

Pennsylvania, while still leaning D, has a https://t.co/1RziVhte02

I went down a deep Polytopia rabbit hole for a while. Got to #1 on Perfection once and a 1609 ELO, then had to pull the plug, as it was taking up too much cognitive load even when I wasn’t playing the game.

How ironic that the same people on the left who say that they want to stop “disinformation” are also the ones pushing debunked hoaxes relentlessly …

@jasondebolt Yeah, if we lose this election it is game tf over
@pmarca Yeah 😔
@naval True, that instinct runs deep
@stevenmarkryan Exactly
Last election, I didn’t know a single independent/swing voter who was voting for Trump. 

This time, I don’t know anyone who isn’t.

And one person after another has confided in me that they’re voting for Trump, but they’re afraid to say so publicly, because it will affect their

Send people links to the actual source data on https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy!

All it takes is for people to hear @realDonaldTrump’s actual speeches or to see a compilation of Jewish speakers at the MSG rally to start realizing how much they were lied to by legacy media.
@EndWokeness Yeah
True
But the legacy media says this never happens
@iam_smx Making good progress
@Rothmus They never actually move to Canada (unfortunately)
It is NOT ok for the government to barge into your home and kill your pets!

@fentasyl The Trump administration will make evidence-based decisions. For my part, I will certainly strongly and publicly oppose anything based on mystical nonsense!

My inclination is in favor of fluoride, but I am open to hearing evidence against it too.

@shellenberger @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @BrendanCarrFCC Yeah, that futile attempt to sway the election using public airwaves was not cool
💯

Those are their stated goals!

Unless @realDonaldTrump wins, this will be the last election. 

The Dems will legalize all the illegals in swing states, so there be no more swing states. America will become a one-party, deep blue socialist state.
@SaltyGoat17 @CollinRugg Literally zero

@nypost Obviously
@DefiyantlyFree Correct. 

As of yesterday’s data, D vs R early votes are 602k worse for D than 2020 when Biden only had an 80k margin of victory. 

That is almost 10% of the probable electorate (6.9M voted in 2020)!

Unless something very strange happens, Ds will have a blowout loss in PA.
Citizen journalism is the only way to break out of the legacy media propaganda machine.

Exactly. 

It is easy for Cheney to send others to die while having fancy dinners in DC, but she would think very differently if on the front lines herself.
Correct. 

In fact, SpaceX received only half the money that Boeing did to develop a crewed spacecraft, yet has done ALL the completed missions!

@stillgray Deeply wrong
@_johnnymaga Her sad question to the SNL cast member hoping she was registered to vote in Pennsylvania tells it all: that state is the key to the election and she’s losing badly.
@farzyness Yeah
@MarioNawfal @jordanbpeterson @GadSaad @mayemusk Yeah
Cool 😎
@WesternLensman Ironically, the Democrats are massively outspending Republicans in this election!!

I would gladly take the deal that all money needs to come out of politics. The Dems would be far worse off.
Pennsylvania is on track for a major Republican victory. 

The gap between 2024 and 2020 is now over 600k, which almost 10% of the entire electorate! https://t.co/1IGuyjM0Xx

The government should not be allowed to barge into your house and kill your pet! That’s messed up.

The legacy media is the propaganda arm of the radical leftists, so will immediately go after anyone who merely wants centrist policies and fairness for all. 

The policy positions of my @America PAC are just common sense and moderate by any reasonable definition.
@TiffanyFong_ The illusion of him being in charge has been broken. He was always just a puppet, as is Kamala.
Government overreach kidnapped an orphan squirrel and executed him …
Exactly. The reason that the public no longer trusts the legacy media is that the media has been exposed as lying too many times to count.

@sustainableanna @VanSeedBank Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
@IamSamCrompton Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp.

@ben_made_new @paulkrugman I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
@paulkrugman However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive.
@Youri_Hart Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
@paulkrugman For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses.

Got to regulate AI/robotics like we do food, drugs, aircraft &amp; cars. Public risks require public oversight. Getting rid of the FAA wdn’t make flying safer. They’re there for good reason.

Initial Hat Offering going great w over $300k in hat sales already! Thanks for buying our super boring hat. You rock, figuratively &amp; literally. All cash goes directly towards more boring.
@commagere For one thing, aliens obv built the pyramids! Who but aliens could have figured out how to align and stack stone blocks in a series of concentric squares!? Um, ok, I guess maybe people.
Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe … 

Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities.
Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

@rjcc @Tesla Do you really believe that someone’s life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize?
@rjcc @Tesla That is a *counterpoint* to illustrate absurdity, meaning that obviously a single careless statement should *not* ruins someone’s life

@teslamodel3fan @FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is "What color?". Don't need a configurator for that.
@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference.
@MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now
@OutOnALumb @engadget Yeah
@nextspaceflight @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!

@MacTechGenius @Jon4Lakers @solarcity @Tesla Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action …
@ismailnathij @stapf @Tesla The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
@ismailnathij @stapf @Tesla Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums.
@ricardorossello Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today

Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.

@kglickstein @LeeannTweeden Kinda have to :)
@DrChrisVieira LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
@libbycwatson Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions.
@JosephThuney Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
@mariom An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go
@ejohnson99 City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you.
Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly
@curiousworlds For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
@DaveLeeBBC Support would be much appreciated!
City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city
Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.
@jeff_foust Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship
@aylaberan True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts.
@FredericLambert @ka_choo_choo @ElectrekCo Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
@ElectrekCo Not true. Email from customer. https://t.co/4P3QO7EMLW

@GoDaddy I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
@fcingolani Good point
Fixed. Now it's good.
@BenedictEvans @stevesi Stay tuned
Excited to announce the launch of https://t.co/J6TuRWIQAA! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow.
@AuerSusan @valleyhack True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is needed ...

@SpaceX @INTELSAT Thanks @INTELSAT! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was 28,000 km, Falcon 9 achieved 43,000 km.
SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good. https://t.co/R3YrF6PEt4
@SpaceX We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec
Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500.
Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
@cristian_miuta @TeslaMotors Norway is awesome

No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long. https://t.co/N6kxxQeFby
@migueldelagza They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it… https://t.co/0wFgXMgeqZ
@nullpointr More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
@amirmasoudabdol Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours.
@BenjaminCoop3 Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
@mjmdavis Still humans
@TheCocoaNaut Significantly improves control force
Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight. https://t.co/6ZcSG29B74

@dnathe4th @DJSnM We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago
@CrappyUsername Not only that, it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon
@EcoHeliGuy Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
@zerosixbravo @john_gilleran True, but that's a minor factor for rockets
@ClovenLife No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
@DJSnM They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that.
@zerosixbravo Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding. https://t.co/SmyCCQRt2F
@sajo Sticking to 100
@Emerald0013 It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace
Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good
Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

@StevePrediletto @samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
@FredericLambert @samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
@samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?
@samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.
@RITSPEX @ID_AA_Carmack @mmeijeri Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover.
@ID_AA_Carmack @mmeijeri The faster, the better. Gravity losses.

@WaldekKubicki @shazm01 Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
@sethjacob14 Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot.
@shazm01 We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
@douglasprest Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety
@noradio @MCornell0 @marks22 Exactly
@tony_lo Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
@freerobby @jetkohli There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
@marks22 HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
@harropj Hopefully June for those too
@MacBenTosh S for sure. It is a bigger car.
@jetkohli I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3.
@TheAvinashSingh Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.
@rrosenbl Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth.
@ethank Almost there, plus much improved web browser
@kedyson1 That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
@RITSPEX Almost there. Probably in a few months.

@torbenanderson U.K. delivery and installation next year
Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about 10 hours ...

@GeorgeChiesa It's a good one
@jovanik21 Thanks for doing it!
Headed to see Guardians 2 w my bro and kids. Loved the first one.
@keithdcohen I do love Banks, but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships
@zanesloanbc Simple. I like it.
Kinda like Snoop Dug
@AndrewHws I don't want to be presumptuous
I know what you're thinking … then why not "the Third"? Well, I've learned my lesson about 3's.
@reviewero By calling it "the Second", it has more credibility
Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine, the Second
@ivanmartinsanz Boring Not Boring
@ivanmartinsanz Good one
@hunterbarnes144 Been done
Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine …
Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful … https://t.co/gp0aNnWxcM
Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then… https://t.co/RM8kDgazVX
Landing https://t.co/m8DH1DkvFO
Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit. https://t.co/nBzBMNdjBp
Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper. https://t.co/epHQQvajOZ
@VoltzCoreAudio Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so
My boring TED talk

@kmckelly @cstross @jephjacques We def want to avoid either, particularly Surface Detail ...
@PJWU8 @creepypuppet @cowanfilms On it now
@moomoodining @creepypuppet @cowanfilms Great food, great ambience and with great friends. We all really enjoyed the visit.
@JudeBurger @realamberheard @teslaownersau Will definitely do that on my next trip
Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, @CreepyPuppet and @CowanFilms https://t.co/SUM2RYYN7O
@juancarlosrs @elpilot That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
@FredericLambert @TaylorSMarks @FlipperB @pkingdesign Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for 75 kWh packs that are software created to 60, so not 2013.
@gucci_mau July
@NoahMagel Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months
@SamGonzales Next gen Roadster will be convertible
Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
@danahull @Reuters Yeah
@Reuters Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it.
@Reuters This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest https://t.co/KcXFhqwXVa
@chairheadMD @cheron Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to 100%.
@SeanRowley2 Latency should only be 5 min max. Checking ...

And so the robots spared humanity ... https://t.co/v7JUJQWfCv
@ForIn2020 @waltmossberg @mims @defcon_5 Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.
Stormy weather in Shortville ...
@DaveLeeBBC @verge Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.
@Lexxxzis It's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing
@verge It won't matter
@SuperCoolCube Pretty good
Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?
Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
@BadAstronomer We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
@tesla_addict @TeslaMotors Working on it
@jasonlamb Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
@cheron A lot
@Cardoso Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
@redletterdave Good point, odds go from 0% to &gt;0% :)
Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot.
@oxfordteddy Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
@BadAstronomer @SpaceX Thanks Phil!
Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times
@drmanejwala @arctechinc On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance.
@danahull Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.
@business Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
@nickg_uk @chouky02 You won't care
@NakatomiTim What gave me away?
Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ... https://t.co/mA8ZgutrbE
Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to.
@erikhaaland We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
@nickbaum I believe so
@Mr_Ewe_Guy Oh so little faith
@kryniog The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
@ToddGerkens Yeah
@HolsMichael Start taking orders in April
@dr_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.
@akaWrecks @ckalapala Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …
@CamKode The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
@BlueBowles If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.
@juanmlemao No problem :)
@DJBurges Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.
@faultywarrior @matt_trulli @FredericLambert @TimShelton @JimPengelly Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
@TimShelton @FredericLambert @JimPengelly First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months.
@meangene2030 Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 https://t.co/zcs6j1YRa4
@FredericLambert It still has one display
@VoltzCoreAudio Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?
@asimo3089 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
@trabru Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!
@oakhaller I think so
@FredericLambert @JimPengelly No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S.
@Trojan81 Tues/Wed
@jDaz Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
@timothymjr Tues/Wed next week
@Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.
@JimPengelly Yes, but not until next year
@AlSaibie Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
@theKen_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot
@Greg525 How about now?
@varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
@luciojr All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
@swindeez Definitely
Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)
Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the "next version" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.
@macwalterslives Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
@aaronpaul_8 I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful.
@nextspaceflight @inversedotcom Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
@lennart375 @inversedotcom The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
@phirate Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle.
@Nites I hope that didn't work
@Nites ~spawn npc.alien
Where are the #%*&gt; aliens? https://t.co/FDuJIdwgrN
@wouterhuijs Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
@x17online Except that isn't actually my house ...
@karaswisher Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it.
@karaswisher I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
@CapnJesus @Lurpatron @MKBHD @jakerawr 3 is a great car, but definitely Model S
@kyleugh Good point
@PriyancaFord I wish. It's so annoying.
Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ... https://t.co/kGpJHNgRJO
@BizbuilderUSA @mcannonbrookes It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results
@Legit_bacon @mcannonbrookes Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ.
@5AllanLeVito @mcannonbrookes @VGroysman Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency.
.@mcannonbrookes Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes
@ah_pton16 I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
@JMMZHerrera Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda "digitizes" DC power
@williamwinters High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://t.co/FOjClHhYiL
Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC.
You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. https://t.co/7uXoUQf29f
@mcannonbrookes Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution.
@shails Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control
@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
@Zedd Will send you one
@SimonaKitzu Self-hatred
Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it! https://t.co/ss2WmkOGyk

SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
@MacTechGenius of course
@DueDiamond maybe one of those too
Roller coasters are awesome
@johnpaulbrewer Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will
@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)
@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
Just posted a video https://t.co/RCV7MVi8rs
@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.
@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.
Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast… https://t.co/upjTcmftte

Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow. https://t.co/bQf97lywn4
@emenietti @chafkin Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed

@LittleDovah Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?
@Floydilicious Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!
Apparently, there is this thing called "Dad jokes" and I make them
@LudwigMorelos You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man...

@mdcdave yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars.
@jovanik21 @Veidit No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.
@jovanik21 Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further
@Veidit No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.
@jovanik21 Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.

@qriosity_ @MacTechGenius No rare earth metals in battery
@camdtor @trylks Almost ready
@MacTechGenius App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
@FredericLambert Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority
@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text
@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
@Wise1919 @FredericLambert Rolling out a new update today.
@recipher We should try our best
@iamDeveloper Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless.

@brendangage I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful.
@DaringKid True. Me being one of them :)
@marcelsalathe Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to "1st" place means it's essentially on par
@andresantoniop Fair point, sorry
Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?
@RealPhillipPoon Needs a major overhaul
@BenCam137 @FifthRocket Exactly
@AanstadGard Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
@BullFlags Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
@W4AS Good grief, I'm not "working" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.
@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)
@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
@zgiarrizzo Exactly
@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?
@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
@Biesseman True!
Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.
@nintendomaniac @alext4627 I wish!
@OldManRiver1800 Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism.

Regarding the meeting at the White House: https://t.co/8b1XH4oW6h
@SarahFKessler @qz Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.

@JacobofAmber Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material
Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material https://t.co/HKIYKbdb3g
@danmoran3 @redletterdave Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more.

@redletterdave Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ...
@danahull I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
@danahull Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.
@TheEconomist This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.
@dean_arexding There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
@tsrandall 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely
@stephenstohn Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present
Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.
@dnansink40 Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks

@HendrikStruik The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted
@gdoehne @reddit Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
@dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically
@dtweiseth Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
@VinnyLingham Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.

@cameronrad Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot
@ModularLifeSys @NHTSAgov It might. Am not sure.
@gavinnwaters Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.

@gurnam @brianstucki @reddit It is
@JRMYGRNBRGR Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.
@trevoclark Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1.
@robsmallshire @ClareMacraeUK It will
Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
@mjreddyMD If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week

@OlivierW4 Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in.
If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000
New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
@fatihorhan @SpaceX That was a great game
Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
@vicentes @DragTimes Late Jan, along with Linux kernel upgrade
@DragTimes Yes, but held up by Autopilot . It def works tho in shaving 0.1 sec off 0-60mph &amp; 1/4 mile. If AP goes tmrw, then perf upgrade goes Thurs.
Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw.

@djsearle @FredericLambert Yes, grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions
@FredericLambert A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?
@yamenalhaddad Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
@FredericLambert There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place.
@ddaogaru If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back
@wpconner Good idea
@SweensChris Should complete in 2017. One is def planned for Swift Current, near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my 18th bday.
@darkdude203 It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel, it will be quieter.
@CMaggiore50 Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car 42.
Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too, but takes much longer.
To activate the Model X holiday performance, just type holidays or ModelXmas after pressing the logo. Also, Mars. https://t.co/8Cy7YPlECX
@CJDSB Looking promising for next week
@pcwizardllc No major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads
@pcwizardllc Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign
@Thebeazles Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
@vicentes That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
@SamLawrence 8.1, which hopefully goes out next week.
@DragTimes Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week

@Contra_9077 sounds right
@ArminKeyani All P100D vehicles produced to date, as well as new. This is purely a software optimization.
Model X numbers should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile
Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month
@ID_AA_Carmack we could enable that, although the cameras use grey, grey, grey, red detection, so it would look a little greyish red :)

@ninjas "smart" preconditioning should be less dumb in 8.0
@notch also, the Tesla is poison free!
@Scott_Helme can't always detect babies and pets
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.

Support &amp; advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com.
Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.

Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
@RuthEdick especially well
@pfierens Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust
@erik_smith1 @ihavetweets certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware

@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it "beta" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.

@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn cool, thanks :)
@gdoehne @disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert.
@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert.

As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.
Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck https://t.co/Sa6uCkpknY
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
@fucktyler Thanks Tyler
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes
RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship

@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.
Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter

Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
https://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE
@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.

@megynkelly Same
@GuntherEagleman @SenSchumer Exactly
Thank you!
I meant what I said
One of the worst bills ever written
Indeed, this is an inflection point.
Unless @DOGE ends the careers of deceitful, pork-barrel politicians, the waste and corruption will never stop. 

Therefore, there is no choice but to do so.

I wish there was another way, but there is not.
@EricLDaugh That’s because they’re too cowardly to do so publicly
Thank you!
Thank you!
Kill the Bill
Thank you!
Absolutely
Exactly, it contains major spending increases and changes to the law.

That is NOT a “continuing” resolution.
How to use Grok to understand any piece of legislation or large document on the Internet
@SenTuberville Absolutely
KILL BILL!
“Shutting down” the government (which doesn’t actually shut down critical functions btw) is infinitely better than passing a horrible bill
Great!
Thank you!
@WholeMarsBlog True
Stop the steal of your tax dollars!
Exactly right. ALL government spending is taxation. 

The government either taxes you directly or, by increasing the money supply, taxes you through inflation. 

That means the spending bill IS the taxation bill. Very important concept to understand.

@RepThomasMassie
@MarioNawfal So many sneaky things in this bill
@JohnCornyn It’s a nightmare bill
Thank you!
@WallStreetMav @SpeakerJohnson What the heck is going on?
Thank you!
Unconscionable
Outrageous!
This should not be funded by your tax dollars!
The bill they’re trying to pass right now would prevent investigating their wrongdoing!
America voted for change, but Congress is not listening. UNACCEPTABLE!!
No bills should be passed Congress until Jan 20, when @realDonaldTrump takes office.

None.

Zero.
Absolutely
Exactly
Call your elected representatives today to stop the steal of your tax dollars!
 https://t.co/6suIuQMcO4
We’re funding bioweapon labs in this bill!
Stop the steal of your tax dollars!

Call your elected representatives now. 

They are trying to railroad this thing through today!
This is insane! This is NOT democracy!

How can your elected representatives be asked to pass a spending bill where they had no input and not even enough time to read it!!??
What a scam!
Absolutely
Thank you!
By now, they should know that I mean what I say
@KevinKileyCA Thank you!

They want to spend YOUR tax dollars on censorsing YOU!!
Stop the steal of your tax dollars!
@alx Absolutely
The more we learn about this criminal bill they are trying to pass today, the worse it gets!!
Absolutely, this bill should NOT pass. 

A new bill that isn’t an insane crime against the American people should be done in 33 days.
Thank you!
This bill is criminal
This crazy bill needs to stop now
@DefiyantlyFree Doesn’t make sense
This bill is terrible
Please call your elected representatives right away to tell them how you feel!

They are trying to get this passed today while no one is paying attention.
Please call your elected representatives right now to stop this madness!
This is an outrage
THIS CRIMINAL BILL MUST NOT PASS
This is insane and has nothing to do with a “continuing resolution”!
@TammieMcDonal17 @BrianKempGA Exactly
Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!
@TheRabbitHole84 This bill is an outrage!
What the heck!!??
The more I learn, the more obvious it becomes that this spending bill is a crime.

It even includes funding for the worst illegal censorship operation in the entire government (GEC)!!
@Austen Starlink will have 20k to 30k satellites in operation by the time the EU satellites are  all launched, so about 1% of Starlink!

This is a child’s toy compared to Starlink.
This bill should not pass
@KettlebellDan Yeah, absolutely needs to be rethought
Exactly
You cell phone in New Zealand now works anywhere!
@SmallPettingZoo @Rob_2628 @Starlink Much easier than Lilith, actually, but the catch is that you only get one attempt for each set of stones and the stones are hard to get. 

Lilith has almost no penalty for as many attempts as you want.

@GadSaad @PierrePoilievre He seems great

99% of cars will be electric and autonomous in the future. 

Manually-driven gasoline cars will be like riding a horse while using a flip phone. Still happens, but it’s rare.

Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making  GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public. 

Nothing else is even close.

The “save the homeless” NGOs are often paid according to how many homeless people are on the streets, thus creating a strong financial incentive for them to maximize the number of homeless people and never actually solve the problem!

This illustrates why the term “homeless” is misleading. The vast majority of those on the streets are there due to severe drug addiction and/or mental illness. 

The issue not that they got a little behind in their mortgage payments and would be back on their feet if someone just
@EndWokeness Either term is generally a euphemism for mentally ill drug zombies. 

Both “homeless” and “unhoused” imply that housing is the problem, but the vast majority of the time that is false.

I forgot to mention that Optimus was doing this while “blindfolded”. We haven’t yet made vision part of the control loop for uneven terrain.

Optimus robots are regularly cruising around our workplace in Palo Alto where vision is used for static &amp; dynamic object avoidance.
@TobyPhln Great work by the @xAI image generation team
The TSLAQ went Q
Try Grok image generation (codename Aurora)
@sundarpichai That will probably happen. 

Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II.

In my opinion, we are currently only at &lt;5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.
Optimus can now walk on highly variable ground using neural nets to control its electric limbs. 

Join @Tesla if you want to work on interesting real-world AI systems.
Note: we are deleting the name of the internal @xAI image generation system (Aurora).
